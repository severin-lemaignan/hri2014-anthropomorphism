\begin{abstract}

While anthropomorphism in robotics is a commonly discussed trait of
HRI, it paradoxically lacks formal grounds. This article
attempts first at providing a comprehensive synthesis of the social
phenomenon of \textit{perceiving human-like characteristics in non-human
agents and attributing those characteristics to robots}. We draw on
social sciences and psychology, as well as on a critical survey of
existing literature in the HRI community, to ground the concept of
\textit{anthropomorphism}. We then suggest to go beyond the traditional
perception of anthropomorphism as a static feature of a system: we propose to
understand anthropomorphism as a dynamic, non-monotonic and
context-dependent process, which evolves over time and accounts for
special events such as the so-called \textit{novelty effect}. To this end,
we introduce a model of anthropomorphism that analyzes the phenomenon
along three interaction phases. These findings are supported by a long-term
study conducted in a real human environment.
