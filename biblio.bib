	abstract = {Recent developments in humanoid robotics have made possible a vision of robots in everyday use in the home and workplace. However, little is known about how we should design social interactions with humanoid robots. We explored how co-operation versus competition in a game shaped people's perceptions of {ASIMO.} We found that in the co-operative interaction, people found the robot more sociable and more intellectual than in the competitive interaction while people felt more positive and were more involved in the task in the competitive condition than in the co-operative condition. Our poster presents these findings with the supporting theoretical background.},

	abstract = {Interaction between humans and traditional robotic systems can be problematic, as the traditional robotic systems often perform repetitive actions in a restricted environment, whereas human interaction is often characterized by novel ways of interactions, which creates an ever-changing environment. Therefore, traditional robotic system methods and technologies are often difficult to apply in situations and applications where the interaction plays a major role. So we developed a new kind of user-guided behavior-based robotics and applied this method to both mobile and humanoid robots, in order to investigate how nonexpert users could develop their own complex robot behaviors within a very short time (e.g., 30-60 min) with no prior knowledge of the robot technology. In the development of the team of humanoid robots, Viki, we used a modern approach to artificial intelligence that puts emphasis on the balance between control, electronic hardware, material, sensory system, and energy. It is possible to develop simple user interfaces with the user-guided behavior-based approach, in order to allow any user to design performances with the humanoid robots. However, we should not only look at the control of robots when designing human-robot interactions, but also on the physical aspects of the robotic system. Therefore, the novel concept of "programming by building" is introduced and exemplified with the creation of a prototype system consisting of building blocks with individual processing and communication capabilities. By assembling such building blocks, the user develops both the physical aspects and the functionality of the robotic system in an easy manner with no need to use a host computer or a traditional programming language. The approach is further exemplified with the implementation of neural building blocks that can later be trained by the user.},

The results revealed six basic dimensions of perception of humanoid robots: Utility, Clumsiness of motion, Possibility of communication, Controllability, Vulnerability, and Objective hardness.

It suggests that anthropomorphism results from a “default schema” applied to phenomena, including machines, that a perceiver finds otherwise inexplicable. Mechanomorphism, the attribution of machine characteristics to humans, is a culturally derived metaphor that presently dominates cognitive science. The relationships between anthropomorphism and mechanomorphism pose a special difficulty for the question, {“Can} machines think?” Does a positive response reflect a cognitive bias on the part of the perceiver or a genuine attribute of the computer? The problem is illustrated for Turing's “imitation game” for thinking machines, and a strategy for constraining anthropomorphic attributions is proposed.},

We used hierarchical statistical mediation analysis to trace differences in people's mental model of robots from these choices. In an experiment, a humanoid robot gave participants online advice about their health. We used mediation analysis to identify the causal path from the robot's voice and head dimensions to the participants' mental model, and to their willingness to follow the robot's advice. The male robot voice predicted impressions of a knowledgeable robot, whose advice participants said they would follow. Increasing the voice's fundamental frequency reduced this effect. The robot's short chin length (but not its forehead dimensions) predicted impressions of a sociable robot, which also predicted intentions to take the robot's advice. We discuss the use of this approach for designing robots for different roles, when people's mental model of the robot matters.},

	abstract = {To allow users without special knowledge to interact with robots, it is desirable to make interaction methods as intuitive as possible. This goal is in many cases difficult to achieve since data flow from the robot to the human is limited, especially if free locomotion of both the human and the robot are required. Therefore, new communication channels need to be created. We propose the use of an augmented reality display together with a wearable, wirelessly networked computer to achieve this goal. This system makes it possible to overlay planning, world model and sensory data provided by the robot over the wearer's field of view. We discuss the system architecture, interaction methods and experimental results. We demonstrate an example application for rapid prototyping of a warehouse transport system using the augmented reality system and a mobile platform. The user can create a topological map in an unknown environment on-the fly by setting and manipulating map nodes. This is done by pointing at the floor with a special interaction device, and issuing voice commands. The map is shown to the user as an augmentation of the real world view. Additionally, the robot's path planning data is visualized.},

This may occur in at least two ways—by anthropomorphizing nonhuman agents such as nonhuman animals and gadgets to make them appear more humanlike and by increasing belief in commonly anthropomorphized religious agents (such as God). Three studies support these hypotheses both among individuals who are chronically lonely (Study 1) and among those who are induced to feel lonely (Studies 2 and 3). Additional findings suggest that such results are not simply produced by any negative affective state (Study 3). These results have important implications not only for understanding when people are likely to treat nonhuman agents as humanlike (anthropomorphism), but also for understanding when people treat human agents as non-human (dehumanization).},

	abstract = {The Uncanny Valley hypothesis has been widely used in the areas of computer graphics and human-robot interaction to motivate research and to explain the negative impressions that participants report after exposure to highly realistic characters or robots. Despite its frequent use, empirical proof for the hypothesis remains scarce. This study empirically tested two predictions of the hypothesis: a) highly realistic robots are liked less than real humans and b) the highly realistic robot's movement decreases its likeability. The results do not support these hypotheses and hence expose a considerable weakness in the Uncanny Valley hypothesis. Anthropomorphism and likeability may be multi-dimensional constructs that cannot be projected into a two-dimensional space. We speculate that the hypothesis' popularity may stem from the explanatory escape route it offers to the developers of characters and robots. In any case, the Uncanny Valley hypothesis should no longer be used to hold back the development of highly realistic androids.},

After discussing value profiles of commonly used objects, it offers a rapid outline of the challenging issues that must be investigated concerning immediate, short-term and long-term experience with robots. Beyond science-fiction classical archetypes, the picture emerging from this analysis is the one of versatile everyday robots, autonomously developing in interaction with humans, communicating with one another, changing shape and body in order to be adapted to their various context of use.

The robot is used as a testbed for studying embodied communication. Our strategy is to analyze human-robot interaction in terms of body movements using a motion-capturing system that allows us to measure the body movements in detail.

	abstract = {Personality is an essential feature for creating socially interactive robots. Studies on this dimension will facilitate enhanced human–robot interaction ({HRI).} Using {AIBO}, a social robotic pet developed by Sony, we examined the issue of personality in {HRI.} In this gender-balanced 2 ({AIBO} personality: introvert vs. extrovert) by 2 (participant personality: introvert vs. extrovert) between-subject experiment (N = 48), we found that participants could accurately recognize a robot’s personality based on its verbal and nonverbal behaviors. In addition, various complementarity attraction effects were found in {HRI.} Participants enjoyed interacting with a robot more when the robot’s personality was complementary to their own personalities than when the robot’s personality was similar to their own personalities. The same complementarity attraction effect was found in participants’ evaluation of the robot’s intelligence and social attraction. Participants’ feelings of social presence during the interaction were a significant mediator for the complementarity attraction effects observed. Practical and theoretical implications of the current study for the design of social robots and the study of {HRI} were discussed.},

This calls for new models of the interaction between humans and robots, taking advantage of human social and communicative skills. Furthermore, human–robot relationships must be understood in the context of use of robots, and based on empirical studies of humans and robots in real settings. This paper discusses social aspects of interaction with a service robot, departing from our experiences of designing a fetch-and-carry robot for motion-impaired users in an office environment. We present the motivations behind the design of the Cero robot, especially its communication paradigm. Finally, we discuss experiences from a recent usage study, and research issues emerging from this work. A conclusion is that addressing only the primary user in service robotics is unsatisfactory, and that the focus should be on the setting, activities and social interactions of the group of people where the robot is to be used.},

Perceived agency was manipulated by telling the participants that the image was either an avatar controlled by a human, or an agent controlled by a computer. The results support the prediction that people respond socially to both human and computer-controlled entities, and that the existence of a virtual image increases tele-presence. Participants interacting with the less-anthropomorphic image reported more copresence and social presence than those interacting with partners represented by either no image at all or by a highly anthropomorphic image of the other, indicating that the more anthropomorphic images set up higher expectations that lead to reduced presence when these expectations were not met.},

However, it has become increasingly apparent that social and interactive skills are necessary requirements in many application areas and contexts where robots need to interact and collaborate with other robots or humans. Research on human–robot interaction ({HRI)} poses many challenges regarding the nature of interactivity and ‘social behaviour’ in robot and humans. The first part of this paper addresses dimensions of {HRI}, discussing requirements on social skills for robots and introducing the conceptual space of {HRI} studies. In order to illustrate these concepts, two examples of {HRI} research are presented. First, research is surveyed which investigates the development of a cognitive robot companion. The aim of this work is to develop social rules for robot behaviour (a ‘robotiquette’) that is comfortable and acceptable to humans. Second, robots are discussed as possible educational or therapeutic toys for children with autism. The concept of interactive emergence in human–child interactions is highlighted. Different types of play among children are discussed in the light of their potential investigation in human–robot experiments. The paper concludes by examining different paradigms regarding ‘social relationships’ of robots and people interacting with them.},

Such capabilities allow Roball to interact with young children in simple and interesting ways, and to provide the potential of contributing to the development of their language, affective, motor, intellectual and social skills. Trials done with 12-24-month-old children demonstrate how Roball can be used to study children's interest in a self-propelled and intentional device.

We suggest that due to these differences {HCI} evaluation methods should be applied to {HRI} with care, and we present a survey of select {HCI} evaluation techniques from the perspective of the unique challenges of robots. We propose a view on social interaction with robots that we call the holistic interaction experience , and introduce a set of three perspectives for exploring social interaction with robots: visceral factors of interaction, social mechanics, and social structures. We demonstrate how our three perspectives can be used in practice, both as guidelines to discuss and categorize robot interaction, and as a component in the evaluation process. Further, we propose an original heuristic for brainstorming various possibilities of interaction experiences based on a concept we call the interaction experience map.},

Here we present three interaction modes that enable a robot to use active learning queries. The three modes differ in when they make queries: the first makes a query every turn, the second makes a query only under certain conditions, and the third makes a query only when explicitly requested by the teacher. We conduct an experiment in which 24 human subjects teach concepts to our upper-torso humanoid robot, Simon, in each interaction mode, and we compare these modes against a baseline mode using only passive supervised learning. We report results from both a learning and an interaction perspective. The data show that the three modes using active learning are preferable to the mode using passive supervised learning both in terms of performance and human subject preference, but each mode has advantages and disadvantages. Based on our results, we lay out several guidelines that can inform the design of future robotic systems that use active learning in an {HRI} setting.},

The emergence of ubiquitous computing raises new challenges for ethnography however, distributing interaction across a burgeoning array of small, mobile devices and online environments which exploit invisible sensing systems. Understanding interaction requires ethnographers to reconcile interactions that are, for example, distributed across devices on the street with online interactions in order to assemble coherent understandings of the social character and purchase of ubiquitous computing systems. We draw upon four recent studies to show how ethnographers are replaying system recordings of interaction alongside existing resources such as video recordings to do this and identify key challenges that need to be met to support ethnographic study of ubiquitous computing in the wild.},

We summarize active social assistive research projects and classify them by target populations, application domains, and interaction methods. While distinguishing these from socially interactive robotics endeavors, we discuss challenges and opportunities that are specific to the growing field of socially assistive robotics.},

Survey responses were collected from 746 {U.S.} households that had not yet adopted a personal computer. The results showed that the integrated model, including {MATH} constructs and life cycle characteristics, explained 74 percent of the variance in intention to adopt a {PC} for home use, a significant increase over baseline {MATH} that explained 50 percent of the variance. Finally, we compared the importance of various factors across household life cycle stages and gained a more refined understanding of the moderating role of household life cycle stage.},

This paper details the development of the {GlowBots} from the early user-oriented design phase, through hardware and software development and onto preliminary user studies. In the design phase we outlined a robot application based on a study of how owners relate with unusual pets, such as snakes and lizards. This led to an application concept of a set of \&rdquo;hobby robots\&rdquo; which would communicate with each other and the user through dynamic patterns. Based on these requirements, we developed a {LED} display called see- Puck, which together with an open robot platform was used for the {GlowBots} application itself. One particular issue is dealing with energy consumption problems, as resources in embedded systems often limit the potential time for user interaction. We conclude with a report on early user experiences from demonstrating {GlowBots} and a preliminary user study in a home environment as well as remarks about future directions.},

The difficulty of tasking robots with home chores comes not only from the significant technical challenges, but also from the strong emotions and expectations people have about their home lives. In this paper, we explore one possible set of tasks a robot could perform, home organization and storage tasks. Using the technique of need finding, we interviewed a group of people regarding the reality of organization in their home; the successes, failures, family dynamics and practicalities surrounding organization. These interviews are abstracted into a set of frameworks and design implications for home robotics, which we contribute to the community as inspiration and hypotheses for future robot prototypes to test.},

Using the data collected in the laboratory, recognition, the selection of partner, and dyadic interaction were explored. Both at school and in the lab, data from videotaped direct observation, questionnaires and interviews were gathered. The results showed that different appearance and performance of robots elicit in children distinctive perceptions and interactive behavior, and affect social processes, such as role attribution and attachment.

Then, after describing our method for generating patterns, we offer and describe eight possible design patterns for sociality in human robot interaction: initial introduction, didactic communication, in motion together, personal interests and history, recovering from mistakes, reciprocal turn-taking in game context, physical intimacy, and claiming unfair treatment or wrongful harms. We also discuss the issue of validation of design patterns. If a design pattern program proves successful, it will provide {HRI} researchers with basic knowledge about human robot interaction, and save time through the reuse of patterns to achieve high levels of sociality.},

	abstract = {This work studies the effect of a robot's design (appearance) in facilitating and encouraging interaction of children with autism with a small humanoid robot. The paper compares the children's level of interaction with the response to the robot in two different scenarios: one where the robot was dressed like a human (with a 'pretty-girl' appearance) with an uncovered face, and the other, when it appeared with plain clothing and with a featureless, masked face. The results of these, trials clearly indicate the children's preference in their initial response for interaction with a plain, featureless robot over interaction with a human like robot.},

Far from railing against a future in which machines rule the world, Moravec embraces it, taking the startling view that intelligent robots will actually be our evolutionary heirs. {"Intelligent} machines, which will grow from us, learn our skills, and share our goals and values, can be viewed as children of our minds." And since they are our children, we will want them to outdistance us. In fact, in a bid for immortality, many of our descendants will choose to transform into "ex humans," as they upload themselves into advanced computers.   This provocative new book, the highly anticipated follow-up to his bestselling volume Mind Children, charts the trajectory of robotics in breathtaking detail. A must read for artificial intelligence, technology, and computer enthusiasts, Moravec's freewheeling but informed speculations present a future far different than we ever dared imagine.},

	abstract = {The idea of robotic companions capable of establishing meaningful relationships with humans remains far from being accomplished. To achieve this, robots must interact with people in natural ways, employing social mechanisms that people use while interacting with each other. One such mechanism is empathy, often seen as the basis of social cooperation and prosocial behaviour. We argue that artificial companions capable of behaving in an empathic manner, which involves the capacity to recognise another's affect and respond appropriately, are more successful at establishing and maintaining a positive relationship with users. This paper presents a study where an autonomous robot with empathic capabilities acts as a social companion to two players in a chess game. The robot reacts to the moves played on the chessboard by displaying several facial expressions and verbal utterances, showing empathic behaviours towards one player and behaving neutrally towards the other. Quantitative and qualitative results of 31 participants indicate that users towards whom the robot behaved empathically perceived the robot as friendlier, which supports our hypothesis that empathy plays a key role in human–robot interaction.},

In particular, our aim is to enable small companion robots to respond in a pleasant way when people pick them up and play with them. To this end, we developed a gesture recognition system capable of recognizing play gestures which involve a person moving a small humanoid robot's full body (“full-body gestures”). However, such recognition by itself is not enough to provide a nice interaction. We find that interactions with an initial, naïve version of our system frequently fail. The question then becomes: what more is required? I.e., what sort of design is required in order to create successful interactions? To answer this question, we analyze typical failures which occur and compile a list of guidelines. Then, we implement this model in our robot, proposing strategies for how a robot can provide “reward” and suggest goals for the interaction. As a consequence, we conduct a validation experiment. We find that our interaction design with “persisting intentions” can be used to establish an enjoyable play interaction.},

The results confirmed the hypothesis that the visual appearance of robots is a significant predictor for the estimation of applications in the eye of the beholder.

	abstract = {Ethnography is a form of anthropological practice. It is
both a methodology and a perspective. Through
ethnography, we attempt to generate holistic accounts of
cultures and peoples. At its core, ethnography relies on
“participant observation,” i.e., the notion that you learn
by doing and by watching, and by the interplay of those
two roles. This means that most anthropologists (and
those from other disciplines who use ethnographic
methods) do field work. They spend time in and with the
cultures and peoples they are studying, engaging with the
people around them, participating in every-day life, and
attempting to make sense of the patterns of that culture.
In 1999, Intel researchers conducted ethnographic
research in five Western European nations. We visited
45 households across small towns, larger cities, and
major metropolitan centers. Our research tried to make
sense of how people occupied their domestic spaces, how
those spaces were embedded within the broader
community, and what technologies were present in those
spaces and how they were used.},

This mechanism extends the power of the infant's existing capacity for (primary) representation, creating a capacity for "metarepresentation." It is this, developing toward the end of infancy, that underlies the child's new abilities to pretend and to understand pretense in others. There is a striking isomorphism between the 3 fundamental forms of pretend play and 3 crucial logical properties of mental state expressions in language. This isomorphism points to a common underlying form of internal representation that is here called metarepresentation. A performance model, the "decoupler," is outlined embodying ideas about how an infant might compute the complex function postulated to underlie pretend play. This model also reveals pretense as an early manifestation of the ability to understand mental states. Aspects of later preschool development, both normal and abnormal, are discussed in the light of the new model.},

Agency had two levels; whether the participants were told they were interacting with a human (avatar condition) or a computer (agent condition). The results showed that the virtual image influenced social judgment. The less anthropomorphic image was perceived to be more credible and likeable than no image, which was more credible and likeable than the anthropomorphic image. There were no discernable differences in social judgment between participants who were told they were interacting with a human as compared to those told they were interacting with a computer agent, consistent with findings from previous reports.

Denying uniquely human attributes to others represents them as animal-like, and denying human nature to others represents them as objects or automata. Cognitive underpinnings of the “animalistic” and “mechanistic” forms of dehumanization are proposed. An expanded sense of dehumanization emerges, in which the phenomenon is not unitary, is not restricted to the intergroup context, and does not occur only under conditions of conflict or extreme negative evaluation. Instead, dehumanization becomes an everyday social phenomenon, rooted in ordinary social-cognitive processes.},

In the process of developing a methodology to measure, predict and explain acceptance of robotic companions, we researched the influence of social abilities, social presence and perceived enjoyment. After an experiment (n=30) that included collecting usage data and a second experiment (n=40) with a robot in a more and less sociable condition we were able to confirm the relevance of these concepts. Results suggest that social abilities contribute to the sense of social presence when interacting with a robotic companion and this leads, through higher enjoyment to a higher acceptance score.},

	abstract = {The market for industrial robots grew rapidly during the 1970s and 1980s, with a peak demand in 1991. However, due to the subsequent recession in the world economy, the market for industrial robots has been slow or stagnant over the last decade. The value of industrial robots has decreased in that term, even though they have undergone considerable technical advances. On the other hand, human interactive robots for psychological enrichment are a type of service robots that provide a service by interacting with humans while stimulating their minds. As opposed to industrial robots, accuracy or speed is not always of prime importance. Their function or purpose is not simply entertainment, but also to render assistance, to guide, to provide therapy, to educate, to enable communication, and so on. The market for human interactive robots designed for psychological enrichment is expected to grow rapidly and to become more widespread. This overview explains human-robot interactions in terms of the relationship between humans and robots, in terms of the duration of these interactions and in terms of design issues affecting human interactive robots for psychological enrichment. Then examples of cross-cultural differences in the subjective evaluation of human interactive robots are described.},

We formalized our assumptions about what could be implemented, then used the Wizard of Oz to flesh out a design and observe users' reactions as they taught several editing tasks. We found: a) all users invent a similar set of commands to teach the agent; b) users learn the agent's language by copying its speech; c) users teach simple tasks with ease and complex ones with reasonable effort; and d) agents cannot expect users to point to or identify critical features without prompting.
In conducting this rather complex simulation, we learned some lessons about using the Wizard of Oz to prototype intelligent agents: a) design of the simulation benefits greatly from prior implementation experience; b) the agent's behavior and dialog capabilities must be based on formal models; c) studies of verbal discourse lead directly to an implementable system; d) the designer benefits greatly by becoming the Wizard; and e) qualitative data is more valuable for answering global concerns, while quantitative data validates accounts and answers fine-grained questions.},

	abstract = {The development of pet robots, toy robots, and sex robots suggests a near-future scenario of habitual living with ‘personal’ robots. How should we evaluate their potential impact on the quality of our lives and existence? In this paper, I argue for an approach to ethics of personal robots that advocates a methodological turn from robots to humans, from mind to interaction, from intelligent thinking to social-emotional being, from reality to appearance, from right to good, from external criteria to good internal to practice, and from theory to experience and imagination. First I outline what I take to be a common approach to roboethics, then I sketch the contours of an alternative methodology: ethics of personal robots as an ethics of appearance, human good, experience, and imagination. The result is a sketch of an empirically informed anthropocentric ethics that aims at understanding and evaluating what robots do to humans as social and emotional beings in virtue of their appearance, in particular how they may contribute to human good and human flourishing. Starting from concrete experience and practice and being sufficiently sensitive to individual and cultural differences, this approach invites us to be attentive to how human good emerges in human–robot interaction and to imagine, possibilities of living with personal robots that help to constitute good human lives.},

The longitudinal approach allowed the children time to explore the space of robot–human, as well as human–human interaction. Based on the video material documenting the interactions, a quantitative and qualitative analysis was conducted. The quantitative analysis showed an increase in duration of pre-defined behaviours towards the later trials. A qualitative analysis of the video data, observing the children’s activities in their interactional context, revealed further aspects of social interaction skills (imitation, turn-taking and role-switch) and communicative competence that the children showed. The results clearly demonstrate the need for, and benefits of, long-term studies in order to reveal the full potential of robots in the therapy and education of children with autism.},

Its sensory channels comprising vision, audition, haptics, and force sensing are used to extract perceptual information about speech, gestures and gaze of the operator, and object recognition. The anthropomorphic robot arm makes goal-directed movements to pick up and hand over objects. The human operator may mechanically interact with the arm by pushing it away (haptics) or by taking an object out of the robot's gripper (force sensing). The design objective has been to exploit the human operator's intuition by modeling the mechanical structure, the senses, and the behaviors of the assistant on human anatomy, human perception, and human motor behavior.},

The essays in this volume represent the first steps by philosophers and artificial intelligence researchers toward explaining why it is necessary to add an ethical dimension to machines that function autonomously, what is required in order to add this dimension, philosophical and practical challenges to the machine ethics project, various approaches that could be considered in attempting to add an ethical dimension to machines, work that has been done to date in implementing these approaches, and visions of the future of machine ethics research"--},

To throw some light on these questions, first the use and limitations of conversational agents (natural language interfaces) are discussed. Then some aspects of the experience of families living in a smart house are described, and compared with that of employers of servants in 19th-century Britain. On the basis of this research it appears that people do not want household devices to be very human, and do not want to give them much autonomy. Designers are recommended to observe two rules: Smart domestic devices should put people firmly in control and should as far as possible be unseen and unheard.},

This study quantitatively probed the impact of anthropomorphic robot appearance on human social interpretation of robot facial expression. The Uncanny Valley"theory describing the disturbing effect of imperfect human likenesses has been a dominant influence in discussions of human-robot social interaction, but measuring its effect on human social interactions with robots has been problematic. The present study addresses this issue by examining social responses of human participants to a series of digitally composed pictures of realistic robot faces that span a range from mechanical to human in appearance. Our first experiment provides evidence that an Uncanny Valley effect on social attractiveness is indeed a practical concern in the design of robots meant to interact socially with the lay public. In the second experiment, we employed game-theory research methods to measure the effect of subtle facial expressions in robots on human judgments of their trustworthiness as social counterparts. Our application of game-theory research methods to the study of human-robot interactions provides a model for such empirical measurement of human's social responses to android robots.},

Then, drawing on published works of Breazeal and Ishiguro I examine the proposed vision of each project. Next, I examine specific characteristics (embodied and social intelligence, morphology and aesthetics, and moral equivalence) of Kismet and Repliée with a view to comparing the underlying concepts associated with each. These features are in turn connected to the societal preconditions of robots generally. Specifically, the role that history of robots, theology/spirituality, and popular culture plays in the reception and attitude toward robots is considered.},

In this paper, we (1) review user acceptance literature and discuss eight prominent models, (2) empirically compare the eight models and their extensions, (3) formulate a unified model that integrates elements across the eight models, and (4) empirically validate the unified model. The eight models reviewed are the theory of reasoned action, the technology acceptance model, the motivational model, the theory of planned behavior, a model combining the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior, the model of {PC} utilization, the innovation diffusion theory, and the social cognitive theory. Using data from four organizations over a six-month period with three points of measurement, the eight models explained between 17 percent and 53 percent of the variance in user intentions to use information technology. Next, a unified model, called the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology ({UTAUT)}, was formulated, with four core determinants of intention and usage, and up to four moderators of key relationships. {UTAUT} was then tested using the original data and found to outperform the eight individual models (adjusted R2 of 69 percent). {UTAUT} was then confirmed with data from two new organizations with similar results (adjusted R2 of 70 percent). {UTAUT} thus provides a useful tool for managers needing to assess the likelihood of success for new technology introductions and helps them understand the drivers of acceptance in order to proactively design interventions (including training, marketing, etc.) targeted at populations of users that may be less inclined to adopt and use new systems. The paper also makes several recommendations for future research including developing a deeper understanding of the dynamic influences studied here, refining measurement of the core constructs used in {UTAUT}, and understanding the organizational outcomes associated with new technology use.},

We present results of an interaction-study in which participants had to play a version of the classical Prisonerspsila Dilemma Game ({PDG)} against four opponents: a human partner ({HP)}, an anthropomorphic robot ({AR)}, a functional robot ({FR)}, and a computer ({CP).} As the responses of each game partner were randomized unknowingly to the participants, the attribution of intention or will to an opponent (i.e. {HP}, {AR}, {FR} or {CP)} was based purely on differences in the perception of shape and embodiment. We hypothesize that the degree of human-likeness of the game partner will modulate what the people attribute to the opponents - the more human like the robot looks the more people attribute human-like qualities to the robot.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare a robot designed using a virtual reality ({VR)} system (termed {VR} robot) with a real robot by using a psychological evaluation to investigate whether the {VR} robot can be used in the same manner as a real robot. To make the direct comparison between a {VR} and real robots possible, the same designed robots in both {VR} and real are used in the experiment. For evaluating the robots on a psychological basis, we focused on six basic dimensions (Utility, Clumsiness of motion, Possibility of communication, Controllability, Vulnerability, and Objective hardness) that ordinary people generally use to perceive robots. Sixty-one participants observed and evaluated a real and {VR} humanoid robots using a psychological scale. Results show that the real robot was evaluated to have higher scores for Utility, Possibility of communication, and Objective hardness and lower ones for Controllability as compared to a {VR} robot. The Vulnerability scores of the real robot and the {VR} robot were not significantly different. The usability of a {VR} robot is discussed in the paper.},

Subjects were also asked to rate the extent to which they felt each animal was similar to themselves and whether they felt the animal experienced the world in a manner similar to the way they experienced it. The results showed that in all cases the perceived similarity and inferred cognitive abilities of animals proceeded from lesser to greater in the following order: invertebrates, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals (excluding dogs, cats, and primates). For pets (dogs and cats) and primates, there was a marked increase in perceived similarity and in the tendency to make attributions about complex cognitive characteristics. The data are discussed in the context of viewing anthropomorphism as a derivative of our ability to infer the mental states of conspecifics—an ability that evolved as a consequence of the need to take into account the experience and intentions of other humans. Although we routinely generalize this capacity to species other than our own, the evidence that the effects are reciprocal is extremely limited.},

In this paper, we explore issues related to human personal space around robots, beginning with a review of the existing literature in human-robot interaction regarding the dimensions of people, robots, and contexts that influence human-robot interactions. We then present several research hypotheses which we tested in a controlled experiment (N = 30). Using a 2 (robotics experience vs. none: between-participants) Ã 2 (robot head oriented toward a participant's face vs. legs: within-participants) mixed design experiment, we explored the factors that influence proxemic behavior around robots in several situations: (1) people approaching a robot, (2) people being approached by an autonomously moving robot, and (3) people being approached by a teleoperated robot. We found that personal experience with pets and robots decreases a person's personal space around robots. In addition, when the robot's head is oriented toward the person's face, it increases the minimum comfortable distance for women, but decreases the minimum comfortable distance for men. We also found that the personality trait of agreeableness decreases personal spaces when people approach robots, while the personality trait of neuroticism and having negative attitudes toward robots increase personal spaces when robots approach people. These results have implications for both human-robot interaction theory and design.},

A mail survey (n = 133) of individuals in Northern California focuses on individual differences rather than differences between technologies.

Compared to generic-feedback subjects, flattery subjects reported more positive affect, better performance, more positive evaluations of the interaction and more positive regard for the computer, even though subjects knew that the flattery from the computer was simply noncontingent feedback. Subjects in the sincere praise condition responded similarly to those in the flattery condition. The study concludes that the effects of flattery from a computer can produce the same general effects as flattery from humans, as described in the psychology literature.

A content analysis of 750 postings was carried out. We expected to find the highest amount of anthropomorphism in the {AIBO} forum but were not sure about how far people referred to Roomba or the {iPad} as a lifelike artifact. Findings suggest that people anthropomorphize their robotic dog significantly more than their Roomba or {iPad}, across different topics of forum posts.

Evaluation factors are described and split up into several indicators, which are extracted and justified by literature review. The theoretical factor indicator framework is then combined with a methodological framework consisting of a mix of methods derived and borrowed from various disciplines ({HRI}, {HCI}, psychology, and sociology). The proposed method mix allows addressing all factors within the {USUS} framework and lays a basis for understanding the interrelationship of the {USUS} Factors. 12 1},

	abstract = {This paper explores how a robot’s physical presence affects human judgments of the robot as a social partner. For this experiment, participants collaborated on simple book-moving tasks with a humanoid robot that was either physically present or displayed via a live video feed. Multiple tasks individually examined the following aspects of social interaction: greetings, cooperation, trust, and personal space. Participants readily greeted and cooperated with the robot whether present physically or in live video display. However, participants were more likely both to fulfill an unusual request and to afford greater personal space to the robot when it was physically present, than when it was shown on live video. The same was true when the live video displayed robot’s gestures were augmented with disambiguating 3-D information. Questionnaire data support these behavioral findings and also show that participants had an overall more positive interaction with the physically present robot.},

	abstract = {Children's perceptions and evaluations of different robot designs are an important unexplored area within robotics research considering that many robots are specifically designed for children. To examine children's feelings and attitudes towards robots, a large sample of children (N = 159) evaluated 40 robot images by completing a questionnaire for each image, which enquired about robot appearance, robot personality dimensions and robot emotions. Results showed that depending on a robot's appearance children clearly distinguished robots in terms of their intentions (i.e. friendly vs. unfriendly), their capability to understand, and their emotional expression. Results of a principal components analysis of the children's ratings of the robots' personality attributes revealed two dimensions labelled {‘Behavioural} Intention’ and {‘Emotional} Expression’. Robots were classified according to their scores on these two dimensions and a content analysis of their appearance was conducted in an attempt to identify salient features of different robot personalities. Children judged human-like robots as aggressive, but human–machine robots as friendly. Results on children's perceptions of the robots' behavioural intentions provided tentative empirical support for the Uncanny Valley, hypothesized by (Mori, M., 1970), reflecting a situation where robots are very human-like, but still distinguishable from humans, evoking a feeling of discomfort or repulsion. The paper concludes with a discussion of design implications for robots, and the use of robots in educational contexts.},

	abstract = {More than 40 years ago, Masahiro Mori, a robotics professor at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, wrote an essay [1] on how he envisioned people's reactions to robots that looked and acted almost like a human. In particular, he hypothesized that a person's response to a humanlike robot would abruptly shift from empathy to revulsion as it approached, but failed to attain, a lifelike appearance. This descent into eeriness is known as the uncanny valley. The essay appeared in an obscure Japanese journal called Energy in 1970, and in subsequent years, it received almost no attention. However, more recently, the concept of the uncanny valley has rapidly attracted interest in robotics and other scientific circles as well as in popular culture. Some researchers have explored its implications for human-robot interaction and computer-graphics animation, whereas others have investigated its biological and social roots. Now interest in the uncanny valley should only intensify, as technology evolves and researchers build robots that look human. Although copies of Mori's essay have circulated among researchers, a complete version hasn't been widely available. The following is the first publication of an English translation that has been authorized and reviewed by Mori. (See {“Turning} Point” in this issue for an interview with Mori.).},

The eight gesture types were presented in two robot positions, a speaking robot and a listening robot. Participants watched a total of 16 robot gesture samples and evaluated each sample on the personality of the robot and their impressions. The evaluation results provided basic guidelines to express robot personalities through gestures, describing specific methods to control the speed, velocity, and frequency of a gesture. In addition, it was found that personality expression of a robot through gesture and the control of gesture design factors affect user impression of a robot.},

the festival and visitors tended to have completed higher
education. Overall, people appreciated that the event gave them
the opportunity to discover new things about robotics and some
teenagers got encouraged to learn more about it. We conclude
by presenting our lessons learned and make suggestions to help

With the recent development of the field of Social Robotics and particularly Human-Robot Interaction, the integration of intentional emotional mechanisms in a system’s control architecture becomes inevitable. Unfortunately, this presents significant issues that must be addressed for a successful emotional artificial system to be developed. This paper provides an additional dimension to documented arguments for and against the introduction of emotions into artificial systems by highlighting some fundamental paradoxes, mistakes, and proposes guidelines for how to develop successful affective intelligent social machines.},

	abstract = {In this article, socially intelligent agents ({SIAs)} are understood to be agents that do not only from an observer point of view behave socially but that are able to recognize and identify other agents and establish and maintain relationships to other agents. The process of building {SI} As is influenced by what the human as the designer considers ?social,? and conversely, agent tools that are behaving socially can influence human conceptions of sociality. A cognitive technology ({CT)} approach toward designing {SIAs} affords an opportunity to study the process of(1) how new forms of interactions and functionalities and use of technology can emerge at the human-tool interface, (2) how social agents can constrain their cognitive and social potential, and (3) how social agent technology and human (social) cognition can co-evolve and co-adapt and result in new forms of sociality. Agent-human interaction requires a cognitive fit between {SI} A technology and the human-in-the-loop as designer of, user of and participant in social interactions. Aspects of human social psychology, e.g., storytelling, empathy, embodiment, and historical and ecological grounding, can contribute to a believable and cognitively well-balanced design of {SI} A technology in order to further the relationship between humans and agent tools. It is hoped that approaches to believability based on these concepts can avoid the ?shallowness? that merely takes advantage of the anthropomorphizing tendency in humans. This approach is put into the general framework of Embodied Artificial Life ({EAL)} research. The article concludes with a terminology and list of guidelines useful for {SI} A design.},

We argue that such strategies can also be used by interface agents, and that embodied conversational agents are ideally suited for this task given the myriad cues available to them for signaling trustworthiness.

	abstract = {The essence of the signal-to-symbol problem consists of associating a symbolic description of an object (e.g., a chair) to a signal (e.g., an image) that captures the real object. Robots that interact with humans in natural environments must be able to solve this problem correctly and robustly. However, the problem of providing complete object models a priori to a robot so that it can understand its environment from any viewpoint is extremely difficult to solve. Additionally, many objects have different uses which in turn can cause ambiguities when a robot attempts to reason about the activities of a human and their interactions with those objects. In this paper, we build upon the fact that robots that co-exist with humans should have the ability of observing humans using the different objects and learn the corresponding object definitions. We contribute an object recognition algorithm, {FOCUS}, that is robust to the variations of signals, combines structure and function of an object, and generalizes to multiple similar objects. {FOCUS}, which stands for Finding Object Classification through Use and Structure, combines an activity recognizer capable of capturing how an object is used with a traditional visual structure processor. {FOCUS} learns structural properties (visual features) of objects by knowing first the object's affordance properties and observing humans interacting with that object with known activities. The strength of the method relies on the fact that we can define multiple aspects of an object model, i.e., structure and use, that are individually robust but insufficient to define the object, but can do when combined.},

	abstract = {Human communication involves a number of nonverbal cues that are seemingly unintentional, unconscious, and automatic-both in their production and perception-and convey rich information on the emotional state and intentions of an individual. One family of such cues is called "nonverbal leakage." In this paper, we explore whether people can read nonverbal leakage cues-particularly gaze cues-in humanlike robots and make inferences on robots' intentions, and whether the physical design of the robot affects these inferences. We designed a gaze cue for Geminoid-a highly humanlike android-and Robovie-a robot with stylized, abstract humanlike features-that allowed the robots to "leak" information on what they might have in mind. In a controlled laboratory experiment, we asked participants to play a game of guessing with either of the robots and evaluated how the gaze cue affected participants' task performance. We found that the gaze cue did, in fact, lead to better performance, from which we infer that the cue led to attributions of mental states and intentionality. Our results have implications for robot design, particularly for designing expression of intentionality, and for our understanding of how people respond to human social cues when they are enacted by robots.},

The paper raises some cautions concerning social isolation and stereotypical behaviour frequently exhibited in children with autism. We present some examples taken from trials with the robots where the children exhibit such behaviour, and discuss possible ways of ensuring not to reinforce stereotypical behaviour and a tendency to social isolation in the children. Especially, we point out an avenue of robots becoming social mediators (mediating contact between children and other children or adults). The paper exemplifies interaction where social behaviour was directed at the robot which raises awareness of the goal of the research, namely to help the children to increase their social interaction skills with other people and not simply create relationships with a ‘social’ robot which would isolate the children from other humans even further.},

For half of the participants, the interviewer was polite and for the other half, the interviewer was impolite. Participants then summarized the interactions in their own words and responded true or false to adjectives describing the interviewer. They later completed a post-task survey about whether a robot interviewer would possess moods, attitudes, and feelings. The results showed substantial anthropomorphism in participants' interview summaries and true-false responses, but minimal anthropomorphism in the abstract robot survey. Those who interacted with the robot interviewer tended to anthropomorphize more in the post-task survey, suggesting that as people interact more with robots, their abstract conceptions of them will become more anthropomorphic.},

	abstract = {The ability of artificial characters to express emotions is essential for the natural interaction with humans. Their
absence could be interpreted as coldness towards the user. Artificial characters can have different embodiments.
Screen characters and robotic characters are currently among the most widely used. This study investigates the
influence of the character’s embodiment on how users perceive the character’s emotional expressions. The
results show that there is no significant difference in the perceived intensity and recognition accuracy between a
robotic character and a screen character.
Another important aspect of the character is its ability to express different emotional intensity levels.
Developers create different geometrical intensity levels of emotional expressions by equally dividing the spatial
difference of each facial component between the neutral and maximum expression. However, the relationship
between this geometrical intensity and the intensity perceived by the user might not be strictly linear. This study
shows that also a quadratic trend is present in this relationship and that10\% steps increase of geometrical
intensity can often be distinguished whereas 20\% steps can be distinguished almost all the time.},

In these cases, it might be useful for the agent to use politeness strategies that defuse the person's frustrations and preserve the human-computer relationship. One such strategy is distancing, which we implemented by spatially distancing an agent's voice from its body. In a 2 (agent disagreement: none vs. some) x 2 (agent voice location: on robotic body vs. in control box) between-participants experiment, we studied the effects of agent disagreement and agent voice location in a collaborative human-agent desert survival task (N=40). People changed their answers more often when agents disagreed with them and felt more similar to agents that always agreed with them, even when substantive content was identical. Strikingly, people felt more positively toward the disagreeing agent whose voice came from a separate control box rather than from its body; for agreement, the body-attached voice was preferred.},

In addition to such basic management behaviors for the class, we prepared social behaviors for building relationships with the children and encouraging them. The result shows that the social behavior encouraged children to work more in the first two lessons, but did not affect them in later lessons. On the other hand, social behavior contributed to building relationships and attaining better social acceptance.},

Expectancy-setting strategies forewarn people of a robot's limitations so people will expect mistakes. Recovery strategies, including apologies, compensation, and options for the user, aim to reduce the negative consequence of breakdowns. We tested these strategies in an online scenario study with 317 participants. A breakdown in robotic service had severe impact on evaluations of the service and the robot, but forewarning and recovery strategies reduced the negative impact of the breakdown. People's orientation toward services influenced which recovery strategy worked best. Those with a relational orientation responded best to an apology; those with a utilitarian orientation responded best to compensation. We discuss robotic service design to mitigate service problems.},

Most user interactions with robots have been limited to tele-operation capabilities where the most common interface provided to the user has been the video feed from the robotic platform and some way of directing the path of the robot. For mobile robots with semiautonomous capabilities, the user is also provided with a means of setting way points. More importantly, most {HRI} capabilities have been developed by robotics experts for use by robotics experts. As robots increase in capabilities and are able to perform more tasks in an autonomous manner we need to think about the interactions that humans will have with robots and what software architecture and user interface designs can accommodate the human in-the-loop. We also need to design systems that can be used by domain experts but not robotics experts. This paper outlines a theory of human-robot interaction and proposes the interactions and information needed by both humans and robots for the different levels of interaction, including an evaluation methodology based on situational awareness.},

	abstract = {Psychologists have long been captivated by the perception of animacy – the fact that even simple moving shapes may appear to engage in animate, intentional, and goal-directed movements. Here we report several new types of studies of a particularly salient form of perceived animacy: chasing, in which one shape (the ‘wolf’) pursues another shape (‘the sheep’). We first demonstrate two new cues to perceived chasing – chasing subtlety (the degree to which the wolf deviates from perfectly ‘heat-seeking’ pursuit) and directionality (whether and how the shapes ‘face’ each other). We then use these cues to show how it is possible to assess the objective accuracy of such percepts, and to distinguish the immediate perception of chasing from those more subtle (but nevertheless real) types of ‘stalking’ that cannot be readily perceived. We also report several methodological advances. Previous studies of the perception of animacy have faced two major challenges: (a) it is difficult to measure perceived animacy with quantitative precision; and (b) task demands make it difficult to distinguish perception from higher-level inferences about animacy. We show how these challenges can be met, at least in our case study of perceived chasing, via tasks based on dynamic visual search (the Find-the-Chase task) and a new type of interactive display (the Don’t-Get-Caught! task).},

The discovery of theory from data—grounded {theory—Is} a major task confronting sociology, for such a theory fits empirical situations, and Is understandable to sociologists and laymen alike. Most Important, it provides relevant predictions, explanations, interpretations, and applications. In Part I of the book, {"Generation} Theory by Comparative Analysis," the authors present a strategy whereby sociologists can facilitate the discovery of grounded theory, both substantive and formal. This strategy involves the systematic choice and study of several comparison groups. In Part {II}, The Flexible Use of Data," the generation of theory from qualitative, especially documentary, and quantitative data Is considered. In Part {HI}, {"Implications} of Grounded Theory," Glaser and Strauss examine the credibility of grounded theory. The Discovery of Grounded Theory is directed toward improving social scientists' capacity for generating theory that will be relevant to their research. While aimed primarily at sociologists, it will be useful to anyone Interested In studying social phenomena—political, educational, economic, industrial— especially If their studies are based on qualitative data.},

I argue that humans have been living in (generally peaceful) co-existence with a number of potentially dangerous species, such as some canines. Interestingly dogs are not born 'pet dogs', it's not completely 'predefined' in their genes whether they become friendly or dangerous. A critical period in a puppy's early life significantly shapes its socialization and behavioral conformation. I suggest that such a developmental model of socialization could be an interesting viewpoint on the design of future generations of robots that need to co-exist with humans, and that humans like to live with. I propose the challenge of developing 'personalized robot companions', machines that can serve as life-long companions. I argue that such individualized robots are necessary due to human nature: people have individual needs, likes and dislikes, preferences and personalities that a companion would have to adapt to: one and the same robot not fit all people. Cognitive robot companions above all need to be socialized and personalized in order to meet the social, emotional and cognitive needs of people they are 'living with'.},

The primary goal of this study was to come to an initial understanding of what features and dimensions of a humanoid robot's face most dramatically contribute to people's perception of its humanness. To answer this question we analyzed 48 robots and conducted surveys to measure people's perception of each robot's humanness. Through our research we found that the presence of certain features, the dimensions of the head, and the total number of facial features heavily influence the perception of humanness in robot heads. This paper presents our findings and initial guidelines for the design of humanoid robot heads.},

If robots are to become an integral part of our society, they must possess the ability to learn without direct guidance from a dedicated user. Robot owners will not enjoy the duty of teaching their robot everything it knows. The ability for a robot to utilize various resources in its environment will enable its learning capabilities to be self-guided and independent. This paper investigates the use of social media crowdsourcing to allow a robot to access the vast information gathering resources available on Twitter. Specifically, the robot will record a human performing simple physical actions, upload the video to its Twitter account, and ask its followers for a description of the actions. The recorded parameters of each action is utilized as input into a multi-class support vector machine ({MC-SVM)} classification algorithm, which will enable the robot to recognize the action at a future time.},

	abstract = {A number of emerging technologies including mobile phones and services, on-line shopping and portals, and games and communities are designed to provide users with control over appearance and functioning. Understanding why users personalise could help design personalisation features so that they promote the acceptance and adoption of information and communication technology ({ICT).} This paper examines the psychological underpinnings of users’ willingness to expend effort to personalise {ICT.} The important role of the basic need of self-determination [Deci, {E.L.}, Ryan, {R.M.}, 2000. The“what” and “why” of goal pursuits: Human needs and the self-determination of behaviour. Psychological Inquiry 11, 227–268] is argued for. Personalisation features can align the psychological resources with the user’s action and therefore enhance performance and enjoyment of use. First, they can promote autonomy and the sense of being an origin and therefore transform technology to ‘my technology.’ Second, personalisation features can support competence by increasing the effectiveness of user’s actions. At its best, personalisation becomes rewarding activity in itself regardless of the achieved effects, for example when personalisable features participate in flow experiences. Third, through its appearance functions, technology can support the basic need of relatedness through expression of emotion and identity, ego-involvement, and territory marking. Several positive effects can be identified: engagement, performance, persistence, identity, social acceptance, and social status. The paper concludes by discussing implications to design.},

The assumptions should be measured not only to investigate psychological factors determining reactions toward robots but also to study crosscultural attitudes toward robots. As far as measurement of people's attitudes and emotions can contribute to the design of human-robot interaction, questionnaire items measuring assumptions of robots should be prepared. To develop these items measuring individuals' assumptions about robots, a pilot research was administered in Japan. The results implied the possibility that Japanese people assume "humanoids" as a representative robots, though this assumption still remains unconnected to realistic assumptions about situations where and tasks that these robots perform; the classical views of robots that physically act for humans remains. These implications present some problems for the administration of the survey. This paper reports detailed results of the pilot survey, discusses implications of the results and problems with them, and suggests possible future works based on the results.},

the same reflexive cueing effect as human gaze. We consider

psychophysics methods for measuring attention by analyzing
time to identification of a visual probe, we compare attention
shifts elicited by five directional stimuli: a photograph of
a human face, a line drawing of a human face, Zeno’s gaze,
Keepon’s gaze and an arrow. Results indicate that all stimuli
convey directional information, but that robots fail to elicit attentional

Non-verbal information such as gaze movement or gestures is crucial to conversation between people. In particular, the effect of a gaze is most important in non-verbal communication because gaze movements convey various information such as timing of taking turns or a target indicated by a person. This paper argues that the important role of a gaze also applies to interaction between a human and a robot. In spite of the importance of the gaze, there has been no study on the relationship between a robot's head orientation and its gaze. We have conducted an experiment to investigate this relationship in an experimental environment named {RM-RT}, where the robot's head orientation is fixed to a particular person during a conversation. The results indicate that people notice the robot's gaze according to the robot's head orientation.},

Based on insights from an observational study of a delivery robot in a hospital, this paper deals with how robotic autonomy and transparency affect the attribution of credit and blame. In the study, we conducted a 2times2 experiment to test the effects of autonomy and transparency on attributions. We found that when a robot is more autonomous, people attribute more credit and blame to the robot and less toward themselves and other participants. When the robot explains its behavior (e.g. is transparent), people blame other participants (but not the robot) less. Finally, transparency has a greater effect in decreasing the attribution of blame when the robot is more autonomous},

To understand the situations surrounding product use interaction design researchers have turned to qualitative, ethnographic research methods. However, stripped from underlying theory, these methods can be prescriptive at best. This paper introduces Product Ecology as a theoretical design framework to describe how products evoke social behavior, to provide a roadmap for choosing appropriate qualitative research methods and to extend design culture within {HCI} by allowing for flexible, design-centered research planning and opportunity-seeking. This product-centered framework is illustrated as a method for selecting a set of design research methods and for working with other research approaches that study people in naturalistic settings.},

This series of studies examined whether and when preschool children are willing to attribute internal and immanent causes to motion. In 3 studies, preschool children and adults viewed animals and artifacts (wind-up toys and transparent objects) either moving independently or being transported by a person. Children explained animal and artifact events differently, even with the kind of movement controlled: They were more likely to attribute immanent cause to animals than to artifacts and more likely to attribute human cause to artifacts than animals. Internal causes were less frequently endorsed overall; however, when asked to describe the insides of artifacts, children who saw them moving alone more often described internal mechanisms (e.g., batteries, electricity) than children who did not see them moving alone. Altogether, the studies suggest that children as young as 3 or 4 years of age honor two principles: For animals more than for artifacts, movement is caused by an immanent source, and across domains, movements without an observable agent have an internal or immanent source.},

We introduce the terms L-intentionality and H-intentionality to refer to these attributions, respectively, and describe this division by using examples from previous research. Social robots provide a particularly good platform for evaluating the presence of different types of intentionality, and we discuss how robots can help distinguish the relationship between H- and L-intentionality, based on a number of possible models that we enumerate. We conclude by highlighting some interesting questions about intentionality in general and the interplay between H- and L-intentionality in particular.},

	url = {http://groups.csail.mit.edu/lbr/mars/pubs/phd.pdf},
	abstract = {Sociable humanoid robots are natural and intuitive for people to communicate with
and to teach. We present recent advances in building an autonomous humanoid robot,
Kismet, that can engage humans in expressive social interaction. We outline a set
of design issues and a framework that we have found to be of particular importance
for sociable robots. Having a human-in-the-loop places significant social constraints
on how the robot aesthetically appears, how its sensors are configured, its quality of
movement, and its behavior.
Inspired by infant social development, psychology, ethology, and evolutionary perspectives,
this work integrates theories and concepts from these diverse viewpoints
to enable Kismet to enter into natural and intuitive social interaction with a human
caregiver, reminiscent of parent-infant exchanges. Kismet perceives a variety of natural
social cues from visual and auditory channels, and delivers social signals to people
through gaze direction, facial expression, body posture, and vocalizations.
We present the implementation of Kismet’s social competencies and evaluate each
with respect to: 1) the ability of naive subjects to read and interpret the robot’s
social cues, 2) the robot’s ability to perceive and appropriately respond to naturally
offered social cues, 3) the robot’s ability to elicit interaction scenarios that afford rich
learning potential, and 4) how this produces a rich, flexible, dynamic interaction that
is physical, affective, and social. Numerous studies with naive human subjects are
described that provide the data upon which we base our evaluations.},

The promise of personal robots, however, challenges researchers to develop socially intelligent robots that can collaborate with people to do things. In the future, robots are envisioned to assist people with a wide range of activities such as domestic chores, helping elders to live independently longer, serving a therapeutic role to help children with autism, assisting people undergoing physical rehabilitation and much more. Many of these activities shall require robots to learn new tasks, skills and individual preferences while ‘on the job’ from people with little expertise in the underlying technology. This paper identifies four key challenges in developing social robots that can learn from natural interpersonal interaction.

	abstract = {This paper addresses the field of humanoid and personal robotics—its objectives, motivations, and technical problems. The approach described in the paper is based on the analysis of humanoid and personal robots as an evolution from industrial to advanced and service robotics driven by the need for helpful machines, as well as a synthesis of the dream of replicating {humans.The} first part of the paper describes the development of anthropomorphic components for humanoid robots, with particular regard to anthropomorphic sensors for vision and touch, an eight-d.o.f. arm, a three-fingered hand with sensorized fingertips, and control schemes for grasping. Then, the authors propose a user-oriented design methodology for personal robots, and describe their experience in the design, development, and validation of a real personal robot composed of a mobile unit integrating some of the anthropomorphic components introduced previously and aimed at operating in a distributed working {environment.Based} on the analysis of experimental results, the authors conclude that humanoid robotics is a tremendous and attractive technical and scientific challenge for robotics research. The real utility of humanoids has still to be demonstrated, but personal assistance can be envisaged as a promising application domain. Personal robotics also poses difficult technical problems, especially related to the need for achieving adequate safety, proper human–robot interaction, useful performance, and affordable cost. When these problems are solved, personal robots will have an excellent chance for significant application opportunities, especially if integrated into future home automation systems, and if supported by the availability of humanoid robots. © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Each child took part in six experimental trials involving two games in which the dynamics of interactions played a key part: a body expression imitation game, where the robot imitated expressions demonstrated by the children, and a drumming game where the robot mirrored the children's drumming. In both games {KASPAR} responded either with or without a delay. Additionally, in the drumming game, {KASPAR} responded with or without exhibiting facial/gestural expressions. Individual case studies as well as statistical analysis of the complete sample are presented. Results show that a delay of the robot's drumming response lead to larger pauses (with and without robot nonverbal gestural expressions) and longer drumming durations (with nonverbal gestural expressions only). In the imitation game, the robot's delay lead to longer imitation eliciting behaviour with longer pauses for the children, but systematic individual differences are observed in regards to the effects on the children's pauses. Results are generally consistent with the temporal behaviour matching hypothesis, i.e. children adapted the timing of their behaviour, e.g. by mirroring to the robot's temporal behaviour.},

The {NIMIS} classroom as a whole is designed to enhance and augment existing classroom practices and to foster collaboration by non-intrusive hardware and intuitive hardware and software interfaces. To this end it seeks to enhance both human and electronic communication in the classroom. Empathy is central to ensuring the quality of human communication and personal development. This paper suggests that intelligent systems that can consider more carefully the processes and feelings involved in human interactions in teaching and learning, may promote higher quality support for students in classrooms.},

	abstract = {Theory of Mind ({ToM)} is not only a key capability for cognitive development but also for successful social interaction. In order for a robot to interact successfully with a human both interaction partners need to have an adequate representation of the other's actions. In this paper we address the question of how a robot's actions are perceived and represented in a human subject interacting with the robot and how this perception is influenced by the appearance of the robot. We present the preliminary results of an {fMRI-study} in which participants had to play a version of the classical Prisoners' Dilemma Game ({PDG)} against four opponents: a human partner ({HP)}, an anthropomorphic robot ({AR)}, a functional robot ({FR)}, and a computer ({CP).} The {PDG} scenario enables to implicitly measure mentalizing or Theory of Mind ({ToM)} abilities, a technique commonly applied in functional imaging. As the responses of each game partner were randomized unknowingly to the participants, the attribution of intention or will to an opponent (i.e. {HP}, {AR}, {FR} or {CP)} was based purely on differences in the perception of shape and embodiment.  The present study is the first to apply functional neuroimaging methods to study human-robot interaction on a higher cognitive level such as {ToM.} We hypothesize that the degree of anthropomorphism and embodiment of the game partner will modulate cortical activity in previously detected {ToM} networks as the medial prefrontal lobe and anterior cingulate cortex.},

We have provided examples that help reveal what “invisible in use” might mean but acknowledge that a great deal of research remains to be done in order to move from this to actual designs.

Experiments were set up in eldercare institutions where an interface robot with simulated conversational capabilities was used in a Wizard of Oz experiment. The robot was used with two conditions: a more socially communicative (the robot made use of a larger set of social abilities in interaction) and a less socially communicative interface. Participants (n=40) were observed in 5 minute interaction sessions and were asked to answer questions on perceived social abilities and technology acceptance. Results show that participants who were confronted with the more socially communicative version of the robot felt more comfortable and were more expressive in communicating with it. This suggests that the more socially communicative condition would be more likely to be accepted as a conversational partner. Furthermore, results did show a correlation between perceived social abilities and some aspects of technology acceptance, but this did not relate to the more and less socially communicative conditions. 1.},

In this paper, we present a series of techniques for anticipating people's behavior in a public space, mainly based on the analysis of accumulated trajectories, and we demonstrate the use of these techniques in a social robot. We placed a ubiquitous sensor network consisting of six laser range finders in a shopping arcade. The system tracks people's positions as well as their local behaviors such as fast walking, idle walking, or stopping. We accumulated people's trajectories for a week, applying a clustering technique to the accumulated trajectories to extract information about the use of space and people's typical global behaviors. This information enables the robot to target its services to people who are walking idly or stopping. The robot anticipates both the areas in which people are likely to perform these behaviors, and also the probable local behaviors of individuals a few seconds in the future. In a field experiment we demonstrate that this system enables the robot to serve people efficiently.},

Fundamental to our analysis is the concept of home as living space that unfolds into a collection of multiple centers – home as activity center, entertainment center, work center, information center, communication center, learning center and shopping center. In our analysis, the living space is subdivided structurally into social, physical and technological spaces in which the centers are embedded as organic elements. The integration of the centers with the living space model is fundamental to understanding the home as a networked home.},

	abstract = {Time-diary data from representative samples of American adults show that the number of overall hours of domestic labor (excluding child care and shopping) has continued to decline steadily and predictably since 1965. This finding is mainly due to dramatic declines among women (both in and out of the paid labor market), who have cut their housework hours almost in half since the 1960s: about half of women's 12-hour-per-week decline can be accounted for by compositional shifts-such as increased labor force participation, later marriage, and fewer children. In contrast, men's housework time has almost doubled during this period (to the point where men were responsible for a third of housework in the 1990s), and only about 15\% of their five-hour-per-week increase can be attributed to compositional factors. Parallel results on gender differences in housework were obtained from the National Survey of Families and Households estimate data, even though these produce figures 50\% higher than diary data. Regression results examining factors related to wives' and husbands' housework hours show more support for the time-availability and relative-resource models of household production than for the gender perspective, although there is some support for the latter perspective as well.},

Today there is research aiming at using robots as care support as well as social agents introduced in geriatric care and home care. Much of the research is aimed at the development of cognitive and social agents, since robot agents are considered to need ways of interacting with the people in the surrounding areas. In this perspective it is necessary to start thinking of robots not only in terms of social, cognitive or sociable, but also of socially acceptable. What are the requirements for a socially acceptable robot, and which properties in a robot provide for making it more or less acceptable as part of a social environment? In this paper a set of tentative acceptance properties is presented, together with the results from a pilot study trying to assess the importance of some of these properties for the social acceptance of domestic service robots.},

However, "direct" interaction/contact with the "robot," often causes significant inconvenience and usability problems. In this paper, we present an alternative to the anthropomorphic interface using a projected display and indirect, yet already familiar {GUI} based interaction. That is, the projector (on the moving robot) projects information on the nearby surface and provides a relatively large area through which indirect {GUI} based interaction can occur. As an instance of such an {HRI} paradigm, we present a moving robot kiosk that projects displays around itself and serve and interact with multiple people at once. We report our on-going development efforts and a pilot experimental study that compares it to the typical touch screen based direct {HRI.}},

Contexts in which relationships are particularly important are described, together with specific benefits (like trust) and task outcomes (like improved learning) known to be associated with relationship quality. We especially consider the problem of designing for long-term interaction, and define relational agents as computational artifacts designed to establish and maintain long-term social-emotional relationships with their users. We construct the first such agent, and evaluate it in a controlled experiment with 101 users who were asked to interact daily with an exercise adoption system for a month. Compared to an equivalent task-oriented agent without any deliberate social-emotional or relationship-building skills, the relational agent was respected more, liked more, and trusted more, even after four weeks of interaction. Additionally, users expressed a significantly greater desire to continue working with the relational agent after the termination of the study. We conclude by discussing future directions for this research together with ethical and other ramifications of this work for {HCI} designers.},

The Uncanny Valley questions widely held assumptions about the correlation between realism and believability within a virtual world. There is considerable anecdotal evidence for the uncanny from film, {CGI} and sculpture, but this does not in itself support the valley model. Four hypothesises are proposed; considering the role of presence, mismatch of cue realism, the contribution of the eyes and cultural habituation.

The prototype consists of a projector subsystem for information display and a real-time tracking vision subsystem to recognize the human's action. Two levels of interaction using a virtual operational panel and interactive image panel have been developed. This paper presents the third subsystem, the interactive hand pointer used for selecting objects or positions in the environment via the operator's hand gestures. The system visually tracks the operator's pointing hand and projects a mark at the indicated position using an {LCD} projector. Since the mark can be observed directly in the real work space without monitor displays or {HMDs}, correction of the indicated position by moving the hand is very easy for the operator. The system enables projection of a mark not only at a target plane with a known height but also to a plane with an unknown height. Experimental results of a pick-and-place task demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed system},

In the present study, the go/no-go association task was used to assess implicit associations among social categories exemplifying the two senses of humanness, traits representing these senses, and the two types of nonhumans. Congruent associations (among artists, human-nature traits, and animals; among businesspeople, uniquely human traits, and automata) were consistently stronger than incongruent associations. Explicit ratings supported these differential associations. Social perception may involve two subtle ways of dehumanizing others.},

	abstract = {This article argues that because the home is so familiar, it is necessary to make it strange, or defamiliarize it, in order to open its design space. Critical approaches to technology design are of both practical and social importance in the home. Home appliances are loaded with cultural associations such as the gendered division of domestic labor that are easy to overlook. Further, homes are not the same everywhere---even within a country. Peoples' aspirations and desires differ greatly across and between cultures. The target of western domestic technology design is often not the user, but the consumer. Web refrigerators that create shopping lists, garbage cans that let advertisers know what is thrown away, cabinets that monitor their contents and order more when supplies are low are central to current images of the wireless, digital home of the future. Drawing from our research in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Asia, we provide three different narratives of defamiliarization. A historical reading of American kitchens provides a lens with which to scrutinize new technologies of domesticity, an ethnographic account of an extended social unit in England problematizes taken-for-granted domestic technologies, and a comparative ethnography of the role of information and communication technologies in the daily lives of urban Asia's middle classes reveals the ways in which new technologies can be captured and domesticated in unexpected ways. In the final section of the article, we build on these moments of defamiliarization to suggest a broad set of challenges and strategies for design in the home.},

	abstract = {During conversations, speakers employ a number of verbal and nonverbal mechanisms to establish who participates in the conversation, when, and in what capacity. Gaze cues and mechanisms are particularly instrumental in establishing the participant roles of interlocutors, managing speaker turns, and signaling discourse structure. If humanlike robots are to have fluent conversations with people, they will need to use these gaze mechanisms effectively. The current work investigates people's use of key conversational gaze mechanisms, how they might be designed for and implemented in humanlike robots, and whether these signals effectively shape human-robot conversations. We focus particularly on whether humanlike gaze mechanisms might help robots signal different participant roles, manage turn-exchanges, and shape how interlocutors perceive the robot and the conversation. The evaluation of these mechanisms involved 36 trials of three-party human-robot conversations. In these trials, the robot used gaze mechanisms to signal to its conversational partners their roles either of two addressees, an addressee and a bystander, or an addressee and a nonparticipant. Results showed that participants conformed to these intended roles 97\% of the time. Their conversational roles affected their rapport with the robot, feelings of groupness with their conversational partners, and attention to the task.},

This paper provides a general overview of some of the issues arising from the design of an affect recognition framework for artificial companions. Limitations and challenges are discussed with respect to other capabilities of companions and a real world scenario where an {iCat} robot plays chess with children is presented. In this scenario, affective states that a robot companion should be able to recognise are identified and the non-verbal behaviours that are affected by the occurrence of these states in the children are investigated. The experimental results aim to provide the foundation for the design of an affect recognition system for a game companion: in this interaction scenario children tend to look at the {iCat} and smile more when they experience a positive feeling and they are engaged with the {iCat.}},

Various theoretical approaches have tried to explain this phenomenon: According to the Threshold Model of Social Influence (Blascovich et al., 2002), the social influence of real persons who are represented by avatars will always be high, whereas the influence of an artificial entity depends on the realism of its behavior. Conversely, the Ethopoeia concept (Nass \&amp; Moon, 2000) predicts that automatic social reactions are triggered by situations as soon as they include social cues. The presented study evaluates whether participants´ belief in interacting with either an avatar (a virtual representation of a human) or an agent (autonomous virtual person) lead to different social effects. We used a 2 × 2 design with two levels of agency (agent or avatar) and two levels of behavioral realism (showing feedback behavior versus showing no behavior). We found that the belief of interacting with either an avatar or an agent barely resulted in differences with regard to the evaluation of the virtual character or behavioral reactions, whereas higher behavioral realism affected both. It is discussed to what extent the results thus support the Ethopoeia concept.},

We studied how people experience a multimodal timetable system with varying degree of human-like spoken feedback in a Wizard-of-Oz study. The results showed that users' views and preferences lean significantly towards anthropomorphism after actually experiencing the multimodal timetable system. The more human-like the spoken feedback is the more participants preferred the system to be human-like. The results also showed that the users experience matched their preferences. This shows that in order to appreciate a human-like interface, the users have to experience it.},

For this aim, a cross-cultural research instrument, the robot assumptions questionnaire ({RAQ)} was administered to university students in Japan, Korea, and the {USA.} As a result, it was found that the Japanese students more strongly assume autonomy, social relationships, and emotional capacity of humanoid robots than the Korean and {USA} students, and there are more detailed cultural differences of assumptions about humanoids related to daily-life fields, in particular, pedagogical fields. Moreover, it was found that the {USA} students have more ambivalent images of humanoids than the Japanese students, and the Korean students have more careful attitudes toward humanoid robots than the Japanese students.

Participants (n=40) were observed in 5 minute interaction sessions and were asked to answer questions on perceived social abilities and technology acceptance. Results show that participants who were confronted with the more socially communicative version of the robot felt more comfortable and were more expressive in communicating with it. This suggests that the more socially communicative condition would be more likely to be accepted as a conversational partner.

However, some subjects gave severe comments on structure of the cat robot appearance because they associated and compared it with a real cat based on their own experiences and knowledge. This paper investigates the influence of a priori knowledge into subjective interpretation and evaluation of a mental commit robot. We develop a new seal robot that has appearance of a baby of harp seal. Most people did not know harp seal precisely nor have experience of interaction with it. The subjects evaluated the seal robot while interacting with it. Comparing with the results of the previous research, we show that a priori knowledge on model of robots had much influence on subjective interpretation and evaluation of mental commit robots by short-term interaction.},

Virtual agents can induce the perception of a life-like social interaction partner that communicates through natural modalities such as speech, gestures and emotional expressions. This effect can be additionally enhanced with a physical robotic embodiment. This paper presents the development of social supportive behaviors for a robotic tutor to be used in a language learning application. The effect of these behaviors on the learning performance of students was evaluated. The results support that employing social supportive behavior increases learning efficiency of students.},

For our psychological scale, we used a humanoid-oriented scale that was developed on the basis of parameters for the evaluation of humanoids according to the perspectives of ordinary people. These parameters are familiarity, utility, and humanness. The results show that middle-aged and older females tend to rate the familiarity and humanness of all humanoids higher, adolescents tend to rate the familiarity and utility of wheeled-walking humanoids higher and the utility of androids lower, and middle-aged people tend to rate the utility of all humanoids higher.

The notion of body schema, onto which there seems to be a more widespread agreement, also covers a variety of sensorimotor representations. Here, I provide a conceptual analysis of the body schema contrasting it with the body image(s) as well as assess whether (i) the body schema can be specifically impaired, while other types of body representation are preserved; and (ii) the body schema obeys principles that are different from those that apply to other types of body representation.},

In this study, we attempted to examine more directly the processes by which children infer life status by examining their reasoning about unfamiliar objects. In Experiment 1, 4- to 11-year-olds and adults were asked to name attributes of living things to establish which attributes they associated most closely with life. Children age 7 and younger most often named attributes true only of animals but not of plants; older children more often named attributes true of both animals and plants. However, movement was the single atribute cited most frequently by children of all ages tested. In Experiment 2, 4- to 11-year-olds and adults were presented information about attributes of imaginary objects on a distant planet and were asked to infer if those objects were alive. Again, young children relied relatively heavily on qualities true only of animals but not of plants, whereas older children relied more on attributes true of both plants and animals. Also as before, movement was viewed as indicative of life at all ages tested. In Experiment 3, we examined the hypothesis that children discriminate among different types of motion and that the types of motion they associate with life are in fact typical of living things. Children ranging from age 5 through 11 were found to discriminate among different types of motion and to infer that objects were alive only when they showed the types of motion typical of living beings. The results of Experiment 3 allowed interpretation of seemingly conflicting results that have arisen in previous studies, as well as in Experiments 1 and 2 of the present study.},

The results showed that people in the {UK}, Sweden and Italy evaluated the robot highly in the first factor, and people in Japan and South Korea evaluated it highly in the second factor.

We investigated how a robot should approach human subjects in various scenarios relevant to the robot fetching an object for the subject. These scenarios include a human subject sitting in an open space, sitting at a table, standing in an open space and standing against a wall. The subjects experienced the robot approaching from various directions for each of these contexts in {HRI} trials that were both live and video-based. There was a high degree of agreement between the results obtained from both the live and video based trials using the same scenarios. The main findings from both types of trial methodology were: Humans strongly did not like a direct frontal approach by a robot, especially while sitting (even at a table) or while standing with their back to a wall. An approach from the front left or front right was preferred. When standing in an open space a frontal approach was more acceptable and although a rear approach was not usually most preferred, it was generally acceptable to subjects if physically more convenient},

Although commonly considered to be a relatively universal phenomenon with only limited importance in modern industrialized societies—more cute than critical—our research suggests precisely the opposite. In particular, we provide a measure of stable individual differences in anthropomorphism that predicts three important consequences for everyday life. This research demonstrates that individual differences in anthropomorphism predict the degree of moral care and concern afforded to an agent, the amount of responsibility and trust placed on an agent, and the extent to which an agent serves as a source of social influence on the self. These consequences have implications for disciplines outside of psychology including human–computer interaction, business (marketing and finance), and law. Concluding discussion addresses how understanding anthropomorphism not only informs the burgeoning study of nonpersons, but how it informs classic issues underlying person perception as well.},

	abstract = {Although robots are starting to enter into our professional and private lives, little is known about the emotional effects which robots elicit. However, insights into this topic are an important prerequisite when discussing, for example, ethical issues regarding the question of what role we (want to) allow robots to play in our lives. In line with the Media Equation, humans may react towards robots as they do towards humans, making it all the more important to carefully investigate the preconditions and consequences of contact with robots. Based on assumptions on the socialness of reactions towards robots and anecdotal evidence of emotional attachments to robots (e.g. Klamer and {BenAllouch} in Trappl R. (ed.), Proceedings of {EMCSR} 2010, Vienna, 2010; Klamer and {BenAllouch} in Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems ({CHI-2010)}, Atlanta, {GA.} {ACM}, New York, 2010; Krämer et al. in Appl. Artif. Intell. 25(6):474–502, 2011), we conducted a study that provides further insights into the question of whether humans show emotional reactions towards Ugobe’s Pleo, which is shown in different situations. We used a 2×2 design with one between-subjects factor “prior interaction with the robot” (never seen the robot before vs. 10-minute interaction with the robot) and a within-subject factor “type of video” (friendly interaction video vs. torture video). Following a multi-method approach, we assessed participants’ physiological arousal and self-reported emotions as well as their general evaluation of the videos and the robot. In line with our hypotheses, participants showed increased physiological arousal during the reception of the torture video as compared to the normal video. They also reported fewer positive and more negative feelings after the torture video and expressed empathic concern for the robot. It appears that the acquaintance with the robot does not play a role, as “prior interaction with the robot” showed no effect.},

Results indicated high levels of agreement for classifications of robot appearance between children and adults, but children only differentiated between certain robot personality characteristics (e.g. aggressiveness) and emotions (e.g. anger) in relation to how adults rated the robots’ appearances. Agreement among children for particular robots in terms of personality and emotion attributes varied. Previously, we found evidence for the Uncanny Valley based on children’s ratings of robot appearance. However, based on the adults’ rating of robot appearances, we did not find evidence of the Uncanny Valley in terms of how children perceived emotions and personality of the robots.

In addition the 82 home pages were inspected to assess the extent of personalisation. This correlated significantly with the dispositions {‘Frequency} of Use’ and {‘Knowledge} of Personalisation’. The questionnaire items corresponding to effects were factor analysed. A four-factor solution suggested item groupings similar, but not identical, to those used in the theory.

We have refined our task-based metrics to give a measurement, not only of the participant's immediate impressions of a coach for a task, but also of the participant's performance in a given task. We measure task performance and participants' impression of a robot's social abilities in a structured task based on the Towers of Hanoi puzzle. Our experiment compares aspects of embodiment by evaluating: (1) the difference between a physical robot and a simulated one; and (2) the effect of physical presence through a co-located robot versus a remote, tele-present robot. With a participant pool (n=21) of roboticists and non- roboticists, we were able to show that participants felt that an embodied robot w as more appealing and perceptive of the world than non-embodied robots. A larger pool of participants (n=32) also demonstrated that the embodied robot was seen as most helpful, watchful, and enjoyable when compared to a remote tele-present robot and a simulated robot.},

We found a significant interaction between prototype format and responses across user groups.

This research has been fueled both by concern about the effects of poor body image in children and adolescents themselves and by the assumption that body dissatisfaction during childhood and adolescence creates risk for the development of body image and eating disturbances as well as depression in adulthood. The extant research, however, has remained largely descriptive and is marked by methodological problems. The purpose of the present paper is to identify substantial gaps in the literature concerning body image in children and adolescents. The focus is on four major issues: (1) measurement, (2) epidemiological data, (3) developmental trends, and (4) the meaning of gender. Addressing these and related questions will aid in the development of treatment and prevention programs.},

In this paper we describe an empirical study that attempts to plot Mori's hypothesized curve. In addition, the influence of framing on the users' perception of the stimuli was investigated. Framing had no significant influence on the measurements. The pictures of robots and humans were rated independently of whether the participants knew a particular picture showed a robot or human. Anthropomorphism had a significant influence on the measurements, but not even pictures of real humans were rated as likeable as the pictures of humanoids or toy robots. As a result we suggest the existence of an uncanny cliff model as an alternative to the uncanny valley model. However, this study focused on the perception of pictures of robots and the results, including the suggested model, may be different for the perception of movies of moving robots or the perception of standing right in front of a moving robot.},

	abstract = {The use of autonomous, mobile professional service robots in diverse workplaces is expected to grow substantially over the next decade. These robots often will work side by side with people, collaborating with employees on tasks. Some roboticists have argued that, in these cases, people will collaborate more naturally and easily with humanoid robots as compared with machine-like robots. It is also speculated that people will rely on and share responsibility more readily with robots that are in a position of authority. This study sought to clarify the effects of robot appearance and relative status on human-robot collaboration by investigating the extent to which people relied on and ceded responsibility to a robot coworker. In this study, a 3 × 3 experiment was conducted with human likeness (human, human-like robot, and machine-like robot) and status (subordinate, peer, and supervisor) as dimensions. As far as we know, this study is one of the first experiments examining how people respond to robotic coworkers. As such, this study attempts to design a robust and transferable sorting and assembly task that capitalizes on the types of tasks robots are expected to do and is embedded in a realistic scenario in which the participant and confederate are interdependent. The results show that participants retained more responsibility for the successful completion of the task when working with a machine-like as compared with a humanoid robot, especially when the machine-like robot was subordinate. These findings suggest that humanoid robots may be appropriate for settings in which people have to delegate responsibility to these robots or when the task is too demanding for people to do, and when complacency is not a major concern. Machine-like robots, however, may be more appropriate when robots are expected to be unreliable, are less well-equipped for the task than people are, or in other situations in which personal responsibility should be emphasized.},

	abstract = {Bits flowing through the wires of a computer network are ordinarily invisible. But a radically new tool shows those bits through motion, sound, and even touch. It communicates both light and heavy network traffic. Its output is so beautifully integrated with human information processing that one does not even need to be looking at it or near it to take advantage of its peripheral clues. It takes no space on your existing computer screen, and in fact does not use or contain a computer at all. It uses no software, only a few dollars in hardware, and can be shared by many people at the same time. It is called the {"Dangling} String".                                Created by artist Natalie Jeremijenko, the {"Dangling} String" is an 8 foot piece of plastic spaghetti that hangs from a small electric motor mounted in the ceiling. The motor is electrically connected to a nearby Ethernet cable, so that each bit of information that goes past causes a tiny twitch of the motor. A very busy network causes a madly whirling string with a characteristic noise; a quiet network causes only a small twitch every few seconds. Placed in an unused corner of a hallway, the long string is visible and audible from many offices without being obtrusive. It is fun and useful. The Dangling String meets a key challenge in technology design for the next decade: how to create calm technology.                   We have struggled for some time to understand the design of calm technology, and our thoughts are still incomplete and perhaps even a bit confused. Nonetheless, we believe that calm technology may be the most important design problem of the twenty-first century, and it is time to begin the dialogue.},

A critical pre-cursor to this type of social learning is the ability to maintain interaction levels that are neither overwhelming nor under-stim ulating. In this paper, we present a mechanism for an autonomous robot to regulate the intensity of its social interactions with a human. Similar to the feedback from infant to caregiver, the robot uses expressive displays to modulate the interaction intensity. This mechanism is integrated within a general framework that combines perception, attention, drives, emotions, behavior selection, and motor acts. We present a specific implementation of this architecture that enables the robot to react appropriately to both social stimuli (faces) and non-social stimuli (moving toys) while maintaining a suitable interaction intensity. We present results from both face-to-face interactions and interactions mediated through a toy.

	abstract = {In this paper, the impact of facial expressions on {HRI} is explored. To determine their influence on empathy of a human towards a robot and perceived subjective performance, an experimental setup is created, in which participants engage in a dialog with the robot head {EDDIE.} The web-based gaming application {“Akinator”} serves as a backbone for the dialog structure. In this game, the robot tries to guess a thought-of person chosen by the human by asking various questions about the person. In our experimental evaluation, the robot reacts in various ways to the human's facial expressions, either ignoring them, mirroring them, or displaying its own facial expression based on a psychological model for social awareness. In which way this robot behavior influences human perception of the interaction is investigated by a questionnaire. Our results support the hypothesis that the robot behavior during interaction heavily influences the extent of empathy by a human towards a robot and perceived subjective task-performance, with the adaptive modes clearly leading compared to the non-adaptive mode.},

In this paper, we evaluate a minimal set of physical and nonverbal cues that can be exhibited by a robot to initiate robot-human interruption: (a) speed of motion, (b) gaze, (c) head movement, d) rotation and (e) proximity to the person. We then present a set of studies. For requirements gathering, we started with observations of interruption between humans, with a human actor attempting to interrupt other humans while being constrained to use only a set of behavioural cues that could be mimicked by a simple nonverbal robot. Next, we programmed a robot to exhibit these social nonverbal cues, and tested their feasibility in two separate pilot user evaluations. Finally, we performed an extensive user study of robotic nonverbal interruption across interruption scenarios. People were able to interpret robot behaviour as interruptions, and we identified the dominant cues people used to relate robotic behaviour to interruption urgency.},

A sociable robot will be able to understand us, to communicate and interact with us, to learn from us and grow with us. It will be socially intelligent in a humanlike way. Eventually sociable robots will assist us in our daily lives, as collaborators and companions. Because the most successful sociable robots will share our social characteristics, the effort to make sociable robots is also a means for exploring human social intelligence and even what it means to be {human.Breazeal} defines the key components of social intelligence for these machines and offers a framework and set of design issues for their realization. Much of the book focuses on a nascent sociable robot she designed named Kismet. Breazeal offers a concrete implementation for Kismet, incorporating insights from the scientific study of animals and people, as well as from artistic disciplines such as classical animation. This blending of science, engineering, and art creates a lifelike quality that encourages people to treat Kismet as a social creature rather than just a machine. The book includes a {CD-ROM} that shows Kismet in action.},

The study of the resulting interaction dynamics - with rich and with poor contextual cues - identifies key factors for interaction design and suggests some guidelines for initiating, maintaining, and regulating on-going interaction. In particular, non-directed and directional feedback, turn-taking rhythms, and the interactional kinesics of human-robot dyads are discussed dimensions for {HRI} design.

exive attention shifts, robot gaze did not. These results
suggest a di⬚erence in low-level processing of robot versus

We analyzed visitors' typed verbal responses to a receptionist robot in a university building. Half of the visitors greeted the robot (e.g., "hello") prior to interacting with it. Greeting the robot significantly predicted a more social script: more relational conversational strategies such as sociable interaction and politeness, attention to the robot's narrated stories, self-disclosure, and less negative/rude behaviors. The findings suggest people's first words in interaction can predict their schematic orientation to an agent, making it possible to design agents that adapt to individuals during interaction. We propose designs for interactive computational agents that can elicit people's cooperation.},

Its purpose was to measure the impact of certain features and behaviors on people's willingness to engage in a short interaction with a robot. The behaviors tested were the ability to convey expression with a humanoid face and the ability to indicate attention by turning towards the person that the robot is addressing. We hypothesized that these features were minimal requirements for effective social interaction between a human and a robot. We will discuss the results of the experiment and their implications for the design of socially interactive robots.},

This paper proposes a joint attention mechanism to achieve such joint attention as well as a speech generation system named Linta-{III.} By using the joint attention mechanism, Linta-{III} can omit obvious information in the situation from an utterance description. The joint attention mechanism employs eye contact and attention expression functions. These functions are the robot's physical expressions, and they allow the joint attention mechanism to draw the person's attention to the same sensor information as that noticed by the robot. We have also conducted a psychological experiment to evaluate the joint attention mechanism. The results indicated that the eye contact and attention expression functions were effective methods in the development of joint attention.},

Heuristic evaluation is a technique suitable for such applications that has become popular in the human-computer interaction ({HCI)} community. However, it requires usability heuristics applicable to the system environment. This work contributes a set of heuristics appropriate for use with {HRI} systems, derived from a variety of sources both in and out of the {HRI} field.

Previous efforts at analysis of facial expression have been based on the facial action coding system ({FACS)}, a representation developed in order to allow human psychologists to code expression from static pictures. To avoid use of this heuristic coding scheme, we have used our computer vision system to probabilistically characterize facial motion and muscle activation in an experimental population, thus deriving a new, more accurate, representation of human facial expressions that we call {FACS+.} Finally, we show how this method can be used for coding, analysis, interpretation, and recognition of facial expressions},

In this study, we apply {MATH} to predict personal computer ({PC)} use. We conducted a nationwide survey including 370 households that owned at least one {PC.} Results indicate that attitudinal beliefs are extremely important in determining use of a {PC} in the household. In contrast to previous work examining adopters, normative and control beliefs were not significant in predicting use. Furthermore, several determinants of adoption that were important at different stages of the household life cycle were found nonsignificant in predicting use for the same stages of the household life cycle. Overall, the results demonstrate that the belief structure for household {PC} use is different from that of household {PC} adoption. Further, the results provide additional evidence regarding the importance of including household life cycle in studies of household technology adoption and use.},

	abstract = {When our {PC} goes on strike again we tend to curse it as if it were a human being. Why and under which circumstances do we attribute human-like properties to machines? Although humans increasingly interact directly with machines it remains unclear whether humans implicitly attribute intentions to them and, if so, whether such interactions resemble human-human interactions on a neural level. In social cognitive neuroscience the ability to attribute intentions and desires to others is being referred to as having a Theory of Mind ({ToM).} With the present study we investigated whether an increase of human-likeness of interaction partners modulates the participants' {ToM} associated cortical activity.

By means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (subjects n = 20) we investigated cortical activity modulation during highly interactive human-robot game. Increasing degrees of human-likeness for the game partner were introduced by means of a computer partner, a functional robot, an anthropomorphic robot and a human partner. The classical iterated prisoner's dilemma game was applied as experimental task which allowed for an implicit detection of {ToM} associated cortical activity. During the experiment participants always played against a random sequence unknowingly to them. Irrespective of the surmised interaction partners' responses participants indicated having experienced more fun and competition in the interaction with increasing human-like features of their partners. Parametric modulation of the functional imaging data revealed a highly significant linear increase of cortical activity in the medial frontal cortex as well as in the right temporo-parietal junction in correspondence with the increase of human-likeness of the interaction partner (computer{\textless}functional robot{\textless}anthropomorphic robot{\textless}human).

Both regions correlating with the degree of human-likeness, the medial frontal cortex and the right temporo-parietal junction, have been associated with Theory-of-Mind. The results demonstrate that the tendency to build a model of another's mind linearly increases with its perceived human-likeness. Moreover, the present data provides first evidence of a contribution of higher human cognitive functions such as {ToM} in direct interactions with artificial robots. Our results shed light on the long-lasting psychological and philosophical debate regarding human-machine interaction and the question of what makes humans being perceived as human.},

We currently view intelligent systems and the operators or supervisors of these systems as separate components and conduct evaluations in the same vein. For intelligent systems to become more useful and acceptable, we need to consider the "system" as a synergistic composition of software behaviors, possibly embedded in a physical component such as a robot, and the human interacting with this virtual or physical component. Our objective is to design this team interaction in such a way that the intelligence of the team is greater than the intelligence of any one of the parts.},

While the facial changes in each condition were not extremely different, they still altered how people interacted with the robot. On days when many visitors were present, average interactions with the robot were longer when the robot displayed either a "happy" or a "sad" expression instead of a neutral face, but the opposite was true for low-visitor days. The implications of these findings for human-robot social interaction are discussed.},

First, the use of developmental models will be a critical requirement in the construction of robotic systems that can acquire a large repertoire of motor, perceptual, and cognitive capabilities. Second, robotic systems can be used as a test-bed for evaluating models of human development much in the same way that simulation studies are currently used to evaluate cognitive models. To further explore these ideas, two examples from the author's own work will be presented: the use of developmental models of hand-eye coordination to simplify the task of learning to reach for a visual target and the use of a humanoid robot to evaluate models of normal and abnormal social skill development.},

First, we discuss issues that have surfaced in attempts to evaluate social interactions between humans and robots. Next, we review two observational studies involving robots interacting socially with humans and discuss how the results can be applied to improving robot design. The first is an analysis of a mobile conference-attending robot that performed a search task by augmenting its perception through social interaction with human attendees. The second is an analysis of a stationary robotic receptionist that provides information to visitors and enhances interaction through story-telling. Through these examples, we show how observational studies can be applied to human-robot social interactions in varying contexts and with differing tasks to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate (and discover unanticipated aspects of) the social interaction. Finally, we discuss design recommendations suggested by insights gained through these analyses},

We categorize intimate, loose, and cooperative interaction as extended multimodal interaction. In this paper we show how such di erent types of interaction is realized as an integrated system with robots, people, and computers. Firstly, we introduce our multi-agent architecture to model the environment which includes people, robots, automated instruments, and computers. Each of them is modeled as agent, and all communication is realized in an interagent communication language. Secondly, wedescribe how intimate interaction is realized. We use gesture recognition, gesture generation, and speech generation for interaction. Thirdly, we introduce a software agent called {\textbackslash}watcher " to realize loose interaction. Watcher always looks at the environment to detect whether someone is requesting interaction. It also uses gesture recognition in a coarse level. Fourthly we provide mediators for cooperative interaction. A mediator is invoked each time interaction is requested in the environment. It can gather and enroll necessary agents for interaction by planning and sometimes by consulting other mediators.},

In a controlled experiment, 38 participants were taught a physical exercise lesson from either a specialist or generalist humanoid robot for 6 min. Results showed that specialization had effects on the participants' affective trust; and immersive tendency predicted active participation in the interaction and led to better memory. The latter also moderated the effect of the former - users with higher immersive tendency are more likely to make human attributions of specialization, and rate a specialist robot as more intelligent than a generalist robot. These results have theoretical implications for media-equation as well as design implications for human-robot interaction professionals.},

We conducted a laboratory experiment with 108 participants to test the model and performed Repeated {ANOVA} and Kruskal Wallis Test on the data. The results show that cultural differences exist in participants’ perception of likeability, engagement, trust and satisfaction; a robot’s appearance affects its likeability, while the task affects participants’ active response and engagement. We found the participants expected the robot appearance to match its task only in the interview but not in the subjective ratings. Interaction between culture and task indicates that participants from low-context cultures may have significantly decreased engagement when the sociability of a task is lowered. We found strong and positive correlations between interaction performance (active response and engagement) and preference (likeability, trust and satisfaction) in the human-robot interaction.},

To address this issue, we present a system where the robot is modeled as a socially engaged and socially cognitive learner.

We find correlations in the data, discuss interpretations, speculate about the answers and cultural influences and finally conclude: Whom are we building robots for and what should they be like? To whom are we selling robots and how should we market them?},

	abstract = {People conceive of wrathful gods, fickle computers, and selfish genes, attributing human characteristics to a variety of supernatural, technological, and biological agents. This tendency to anthropomorphize nonhuman agents figures prominently in domains ranging from religion to marketing to computer science. Perceiving an agent to be humanlike has important implications for whether the agent is capable of social influence, accountable for its actions, and worthy of moral care and consideration. Three primary factors—elicited agent knowledge, sociality motivation, and effectance motivation—appear to account for a significant amount of variability in anthropomorphism. Identifying these factors that lead people to see nonhuman agents as humanlike also sheds light on the inverse process of dehumanization, whereby people treat human agents as animals or objects. Understanding anthropomorphism can contribute to a more expansive view of social cognition that applies social psychological theory to a wide variety of both human and nonhuman agents.},

	abstract = {Current research has identified the need to equip robots with perceptual capabilities that not only recognise objective entities such as visual or auditory objects but that are also capable of assessing the affective evaluations of the human communication partner in order to render the communication situation more natural and social. In equivalence to Watzlawick's statement that "one cannot not communicate" (1968) it has been found that also in human-robot interactions one cannot be not emotional. It is therefore crucial for a robot to understand these affective signals of its communication partner and react towards them. However, up to now, online emotion recognition in realtime, interactive systems has scarcely been attempted as apparently demands concerning robustness and time constraints are very high. In this paper we present an empathic anthropomorphic robot (torso) that mirrors the emotions happiness, fear and neutral as recognised from the speech signal by facial expressions. The recognition component as well as the development of the facial expression generation are described in detail. We report on results from experiments with humans interacting with the empathic robot},

In the trial, each visitor wore an {RFID} tag while looking around the museum's exhibits. Information obtained from the {RFID} tags was used to direct the robots' interaction with the visitors. The robots autonomously interacted with visitors via gestures and utterances resembling the free play of children [1]. In addition, they performed exhibit-guiding by moving around several exhibits and explaining the exhibits based on sensor information. The robots were highly evaluated by visitors during the two-month trial. Moreover, we conducted an experiment in the field trial to compare the detailed effects of exhibit-guiding and free-play interaction under three operating conditions. This revealed that the combination of the free-play interaction and exhibit-guiding positively affected visitors' experiences at the science museum.},

Did you ever wonder why cheap wine tastes better in fancy glasses? Why sales of Macintosh computers soared when Apple introduced the colorful {iMac?} New research on emotion and cognition has shown that attractive things really do work better, a fact fans of Don Norman's classic The Design of Everyday Things cannot afford to ignore. In recent years, the design community has focused on making products easier to use. But as Norman amply demonstrates in this fascinating and important new book, design experts have vastly underestimated the role of emotion on our experience of everyday objects. Emotional Design analyzes the profound influence of this deceptively simple idea, from our willingness to spend thousands of dollars on Gucci bags and Rolex watches to the impact of emotion on the everyday objects of tomorrow. In the future, will inanimate objects respond to human emotions? Is it possible to create emotional robots? Norman addresses these provocative questions-drawing on a wealth of examples and the latest scientific insights-in this bold exploration of the objects in our everyday world.\}},

Through modular design, the underlying hardware is quickly accessible and the visual features of the robot (e.g., hairstyle, facial features) can be altered easily. A first study demonstrated the successful implementation of Flobi's dynamic features, whereas a second study demonstrates that the exchangeable hair modules influence gender-schematic perceptions of the robot.},

Our effort is part of what we call robot expressionism, a conceptual approach to the design and analysis of robotic interfaces that focuses on providing intuitive insight into robotic states as well as the artistic quality of interaction. Our paper discusses a variety of ways that allow robots to use cartoon art and details a test bed design, implementation, and exploratory evaluation. We describe our test bed, Jeeves, which uses a Roomba, an {iRobot} vacuum cleaner robot, and a mixed-reality system as a platform for rapid prototyping of cartoon-art interfaces. Finally, we present a set of interaction content scenarios which use the Jeeves prototype: trash Roomba, the recycle police, and clean tracks, as well as initial exploratory evaluation of our approach.},

Despite significant investments in information technology in developed nations over
recent decades, concern exists over the extent to which such expenditures have produced
the intended benefits. At least part of this concern is based around the issue of whether
any information technology is accepted by its intended users. Human factors
professionals are interested in understanding the determinants of acceptance and ensuring
new designs are built and implemented so as to minimize resistance. This concern has
extended the traditional ergonomic concern with usability, or ability to use, to cover
acceptance, or willingness to use.},

We asked people to describe their impressions in free text about the robots. Five psychologists analyzed the qualitative data to categorize all the descriptions into several categories. Then, we made the items based on the obtained descriptions to construct a new psychological scale for evaluating general impressions regarding humanoids. In Study 2, we asked 2,624 Japanese who did not participate in Study 1 to evaluate 11 humanoids on the developed scale. Factor analysis showed that nine factors should be used for evaluating the general impressions regarding humanoids: Familiarity, Repulsion, Performance, Utility, Motion, Sound, Voice, Humanness, and Entitativity. The factor structure is clear and its reliability as a psychological scale is satisfactorily high. Finally, we discuss the usability of the new scale.},

Our findings suggest modifications may be needed to traditional machine learning models to better fit observed human tendencies. Our observations of human behavior contradict the popular assumptions made by machine learning algorithms (in particular, reinforcement learning) that the reward function is stationary and path-independent for social learning interactions. We also propose an interaction taxonomy that describes three phases of a human-teacher's vocalizations: direction, spoken before an action is taken; guidance, spoken as the learner communicates an intended action; and feedback, spoken in response to a completed action.},

This paper presents the results of a nation-wide, two-wave, longitudinal investigation of the factors driving personal computer ({PC)} adoption in American homes. The findings revealed that the decisions driving adoption and non-adoption were significantly different. Adopters were driven by utilitarian outcomes, hedonic outcomes (i.e., fun), and social outcomes (i.e., status) from adoption. Non-adopters, on the other hand, were influenced primarily by rapid changes in technology and the consequent fear of obsolescence. A second wave of data collection conducted six months after the initial survey indicated an asymmetrical relationship between intent and behavior, with those who did not intend to adopt a {PC} following more closely with their intent than those who intended to adopt one. We present important implications for research on adoption of technologies in homes and the workplace, and also discuss challenges facing the {PC} industry.},

	abstract = {Engaging storytelling is a necessary skill for humanoid robots if they are to be used in education and entertainment applications. Storytelling requires that the humanoid robot be aware of its audience and able to direct its gaze in a natural way. In this paper, we explore how human gaze can be modeled and implemented on a humanoid robot to create a natural, human-like behavior for storytelling. Our gaze model integrates data collected from a human storyteller and a discourse structure model developed by Cassell and her colleagues for human-like conversational agents (1994). We used this model to direct the gaze of a humanoid robot, Honda's {ASIMO}, as he recited a Japanese fairy tale using a pre-recorded human voice. We assessed the efficacy of this gaze algorithm by manipulating the frequency of {ASIMO's} gaze between two participants and used pre and post questionnaires to assess whether participants evaluated the robot more positively and did better on a recall task when {ASIMO} looked at them more. We found that participants performed significantly better in recalling {ASIMO's} story when the robot looked at them more. Our results also showed significant differences in how men and women evaluated {ASIMO} based on the frequency of gaze they received from the robot. Our study adds to the growing evidence that there are many commonalities between human-human communication and human-robot communication},

In a 3 × 6 multivariate analysis of variance ({MANOVA)} design, each S rated a single actor/information combination on scales of social evaluation, intellectual evaluation, activity, potency, emotionality, and sociability. Photographs of actors were differentiated primarily in terms of positive social and intellectual evaluation; the speech of actors was differentiated primarily along an activity dimension; and the writing of the actors was differentiated primarily along a potency dimension. Results support the differential information hypothesis and suggest that these 3 types of information about an actor may lead judges to use different personality dimensions.

A content analysis of the interview material derived five key aspects of the future “robotic society”: (1) replacement, (2) competition, (3) safety and supervision, (4) increasing productivity, (5) cost and benefit assessment. Furthermore, a description of what makes a robot different from a machine or a human could be obtained.

This paper describes an experiment in which we gave interactive robots zoomorphic appearances and dog-like behavioural properties. We analysed human reactions to robots exhibiting differing levels of zoomorphism and dog-like behaviour during an interaction task; we were particularly interested to determine whether behaviour and/or appearance that mimicked that of dogs facilitated increased satisfaction in robot performance and a willingness to persevere with a robot that made mistakes. Our findings show that neither the appearance or behaviour of a robot had an impact on the participants' rating of robot performance whilst there was also no significant difference in the self-reported categories of frustration, excitement and desire to persist with an interaction. However, our findings suggest that differences in individual preferences are revealed when people are asked to interact with robots that exhibit dog-like behaviours and other zoomorphic characteristics and that further research is required in order to better understand these differences.},

The results suggest that a higher degree of anthropomorphic attribution is linked to higher expectations of adherence to human proxemic norms. The post-experimental evaluation of the robots’ violations of these expectations suggests an effect in which the reward-value of interacting with a robot which is considered more anthropomorphic counteracts the impact of the deviation from social expectation.},

This seemingly simple question is a subject of investigations of diverse disciplines, psychology, and philosophy originally complemented by neurosciences more recently. Despite substantial efforts, the mysteries of body representations are far from uncovered. The most widely used notions-body image and body schema-are still waiting to be clearly defined. The mechanisms that underlie body representations are coresponsible for the admiring capabilities that humans or many mammals can display: combining information from multiple sensory modalities, controlling their complex bodies, adapting to growth, failures, or using tools. These features are also desirable in robots. This paper surveys the body representations in biology from a functional or computational perspective to set ground for a review of the concept of body schema in robotics. First, we examine application-oriented research: how a robot can improve its capabilities by being able to automatically synthesize, extend, or adapt a model of its body. Second, we summarize the research area in which robots are used as tools to verify hypotheses on the mechanisms underlying biological body representations. We identify trends in these research areas and propose future research directions.},

Results revealed that hedonic robot ({HR)} users perceived more enjoyment than utilitarian robot ({UR)} users, whereas {UR} users perceived more usefulness and ease-of-use than {HR} users. Users with high tendency for parasocial interaction ({PSI)} and high anthropomorphism had more positive attitudes towards robots than their counterparts with low levels of these traits. {HR} users with high anthropomorphism and {PSI} had the most positive attitudes than all other combinations of variables. These results indicate that individual differences play a significant moderating role on user attitudes toward hedonic and utilitarian robots. The results of this study suggest that robot developers and marketers should take seriously the labeling of robots as hedonic or utilitarian, and also consider users' individual differences in order to maximize benefits of human-robot interactions.},

The user creates and executes the robot mission plans through its graphical user interface. As robot deployments become more common in highly stressful situations, such as in dealing with explosives or biohazards, the usability of their mission specification system becomes critical. To address this need, a mission-planning "wizard" has been recently integrated into {MissionLab.} By retrieving and adapting past successful mission plans stored in its database, this new feature is designed to simplify the user's planning process. The latest formal usability experiments, reported in this paper, testing for usability improvements in terms of speed of the mission planning process, accuracy of the produced mission plans, and ease of use is conducted. This paper introduces the mission-planning wizard, describes the usability experiments (including design), and discusses the results in detail.},

	abstract = {Affective reasoning plays an increasingly important role in cognitive accounts of social interaction. Humans continuously assess one another's situational context, modify their own affective state accordingly, and then respond to these outcomes by expressing empathetic behaviors. Synthetic agents serving as companions should respond similarly. However, empathetic reasoning is riddled with the complexities stemming from the myriad factors bearing upon situational assessment. A key challenge posed by affective reasoning in synthetic agents is devising empirically informed models of empathy that accurately respond in social situations. This paper presents Care, a data-driven affective architecture and methodology for learning models of empathy by observing human–human social interactions. First, in Care training sessions, one trainer directs synthetic agents to perform a sequence of tasks while another trainer manipulates companion agents’ affective states to produce empathetic behaviors (spoken language, gesture, and posture). Care tracks situational data including locational, intentional, and temporal information to induce a model of empathy. At runtime, Care uses the model of empathy to drive situation-appropriate empathetic behaviors. Care has been used in a virtual environment testbed. Two complementary studies investigating the predictive accuracy and perceived accuracy of Care-induced models of empathy suggest that the Care paradigm can provide the basis for effective empathetic behavior control in embodied companion agents.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses two important questions in the area of the division of domestic labour. Firstly, what change is observable in the patterns of men and women's time spent in domestic labour over the past twenty years, when taking into account structural factors such as employment patterns and social class? Secondly, among which groups of the population of couples can change be identified? One of the problems of this area of research has been that relatively few studies have systematically analysed change over time using directly comparable large-scale data. Here I present a detailed examination of the nature and pattern of change in the domestic division of labour among couples in Britain based on nationally representative time-use diary data collected in 1975, 1987 and 1997. The data are drawn from a cross-national data archive held by the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex. Notwithstanding the fact that in 1997 women still performed the bulk of domestic work, it is found that, in relation to changes in time use in other areas of life, the increase in men's participation in domestic work (at least as measured in terms of time contributed) should be regarded as significant. In support of this, there had been (i) a reduction in gender inequality in the performance of some of the normatively feminine-associated tasks, (ii) a larger proportional increase in the time contributed to domestic work tasks by men from lower socio-economic strata, to a position of near equality with men from higher socio-economic positions, and (iii) a substantial increase in more `egalitarian' couples.},

This paper presents a new generation of {TUIs} that enable dynamic sculpting and computational analysis using digitally augmented continuous physical materials. These new types of {TUI}, which we have termed {'Continuous} {TUIs'}, offer rapid form giving in combination with computational feedback. Two experimental systems and their applications in the domain of landscape architecture are discussed here, namely {'Illuminating} Clay' and {'SandScape'.} Our results suggest that by exploiting the physical properties of continuous soft materials such as clay and sand, it is possible to bridge the division between physical and digital forms and potentially to revolutionise the current design process.},

The main goal of this research is to explore a new area in robotics, with an emphasis on human-robot interaction. In the previous research, we introduced a cat robot and evaluated it by interviewing many people. The results showed that physical interaction improved subjective evaluation. However, some subjects gave severe comments on structure of the robot when they interacted with it physically. Because of appearance of cat robot, subjects associated with a real cat depending on their own experiences and knowledge, and then compared the robot with real cat. This paper investigates influence of a priori knowledge into subjective interpretation and evaluation of mental commit robot. We developed a new seal robot that has appearance of a baby of harp seal. Most people did not know harp seal exactly nor have experience of interaction with it. Then, subjects evaluated the seal robot while interacting with it},

The second set demonstrates thatpeople exhibit overlearned social behaviors such as politeness and reciprocity toward computers. In the third set of studies, premature cognitive commitments are demonstrated: A specialist television set is perceived as providing better content than a generalist television set. A final series of studies demonstrates the depth of social responses with respect to computer ‘personality.’ Alternative explanations for these findings, such asanthropomorphism and intentional social responses, cannot explain the results.

While there is considerable work on interruption and interruptibility in {HCI}, little has been done to explore how these concepts will map robotic interaction. As part of our efforts to investigate interruption and interruptibility in {HRI} we used {WoO-based} methodology to investigate robot behaviours in a simple interruption scenario. In this report we contribute a design critique that discusses this methodology, and common concerns that could be generalized to other social {HRI} experiments as well as reflections on our future interruption {HRI} research.},

	abstract = {The author argues that in certain circumstances robots can be seen as real moral agents. A distinction is made between persons and moral agents such that, it is not necessary for a robot to have personhood in order to be a moral agent. I detail three requirements for a robot to be seen as a moral agent. The first is achieved when the robot is significantly autonomous from any programmers or operators of the machine. The second is when one can analyze or explain the robot’s behavior only by ascribing to it some predisposition or ‘intention’ to do good or harm. And finally, robot moral agency requires the robot to behave in a way that shows and understanding of responsibility to some other moral agent. Robots with all of these criteria will have moral rights as well as responsibilities regardless of their status as persons.},

The capabilities used to build social robots can be uniquely applied to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of autism, a pervasive developmental disorder which results in selective impairment of social abilities. This paper outlines some of the ways in which social robots can provide unique perspectives to address critical problems in diagnosing autism. We provide preliminary data and observations on how this result can be achieved based on three years of immersion in a clinical research group that performs diagnostic evaluations of more than 130 children per year.},

	abstract = {Much previous research has established that perceived ease of use is an important factor
influencing user acceptance and usage behavior of information technologies. However,
very little research has been conducted to understand how that perception forms and changes
over time. The current work presents and tests an anchoring and adjustment-based theoretical
model of the determinants of system-specific perceived ease of use. The model proposes control
(internal and external—conceptualized as computer self-efficacy and facilitating conditions,
respectively), intrinsic motivation (conceptualized as computer playfulness), and emotion
(conceptualized as computer anxiety) as anchors that determine early perceptions about
the ease of use of a new system. With increasing experience, it is expected that system-specific
perceived ease of use, while still anchored to the general beliefs regarding computers and
computer use, will adjust to reflect objective usability, perceptions of external control specific
to the new system environment, and system-specific perceived enjoyment. The proposed
model was tested in three different organizations among 246 employees using three measurements
taken over a three-month period. The proposed model was strongly supported at all
points of measurement, and explained up to 60\% of the variance in system-specific perceived
ease of use, which is twice as much as our current understanding. Important theoretical and
practical implications of these findings are discussed.},

	abstract = {There is increasing interest in using robotic devices to assist in movement training following neurologic injuries such as stroke and spinal cord injury. This paper reviews control strategies for robotic therapy devices. Several categories of strategies have been proposed, including, assistive, challenge-based, haptic simulation, and coaching. The greatest amount of work has been done on developing assistive strategies, and thus the majority of this review summarizes techniques for implementing assistive strategies, including impedance-, counterbalance-, and {EMG-} based controllers, as well as adaptive controllers that modify control parameters based on ongoing participant performance. Clinical evidence regarding the relative effectiveness of different types of robotic therapy controllers is limited, but there is initial evidence that some control strategies are more effective than others. It is also now apparent there may be mechanisms by which some robotic control approaches might actually decrease the recovery possible with comparable, non-robotic forms of training. In future research, there is a need for head-to-head comparison of control algorithms in randomized, controlled clinical trials, and for improved models of human motor recovery to provide a more rational framework for designing robotic therapy control strategies.},

	abstract = {{HRI} researchers interested in social robots have made large investments in humanoid robots. There is still sparse evidence that peoples' responses to robots differ from their responses to computer agents, suggesting that agent studies might serve to test {HRI} hypotheses. To help us understand the difference between people's social interactions with an agent and a robot, we experimentally compared people's responses in a health interview with (a) a computer agent projected either on a computer monitor or life-size on a screen, (b) a remote robot projected life-size on a screen, or (c) a collocated robot in the same room. We found a few behavioral and large attitude differences across these conditions. Participants forgot more and disclosed least with the collocated robot, next with the projected remote robot, and then with the agent. They spent more time with the collocated robot and their attitudes were most positive toward that robot. We discuss tradeoffs for {HRI} research of using collocated robots, remote robots, and computer agents as proxies of robots.},
